<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">L</span><span class="smallCaps">AID AT CLOSE INTERVALS ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE</span> landing board, the alarm pheromone flashed its message across the orchard air. The last foragers rushed to get in as a foul alien scent mingled with it, sweet and corrupt like rotting fruit. It came from the lurid straggle of wasps hovering near the hive, drunk and jeering. Flora could hear her sisters yelling at her to hurry, but as she descended through the smeary marker trails the wasps littered in their wake, they turned their black gazes on her and sizzled their stings in welcome.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora curved up again on a blade of air and the wasps shrieked with laughter at her cowardice—before she hurtled at one of them and knocked the vile creature out of the air into the apple leaves. The touch of the wasp’s body against hers enraged her and she drove herself up higher, looking for another. But the wasps were already above her, buzzing high and furious as they swayed on their points of air, not to be taken like that again.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Dirty fiends!” shouted one of the Thistle guards to the wasps. “Infidels!” But her trembling antennae undermined her brave words. Flora dropped down onto the landing board between the sentries. She smelled their flaring war glands and knew her own streamed as strong, but a wave of fear came from within the hive.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“What did we expect,” muttered another guard in a low voice, “leaving honey on the board? Advertising our wealth to the Myriad, no one to clean it, everyone rushing out crazed as soon as the sun shines—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">She sprayed another jet of her war scent into the air and the wasps laughed shrilly. They flung back the challenge with a hard gust of their own harsh smell, and its oily particles settled on the landing board.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Closer!” yelled the first Thistle who had spoken, her antennae rigid with rage. “I cannot smell you until I stick my dagger between your filthy plates.” She buzzed more of her war gland at them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Oh, you fat and useless creature,” called back one of the wasps, pirouetting to show her tiny waist. “What pale squirt was that? I doubt you can even fly.” Her friends reeled in the air, hissing with laughter.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Stay!” warned another Thistle, holding back her colleague. “They try to draw us.” She motioned to Flora. “You’re big and brave—get back inside and hold the line.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">S<span class="smallCaps">ISTERS STOOD DENSELY PACKED</span> and silent, their battle glands flaring and weapons at the ready. The smell of fear trickled up here and there, but every sister pointed her antennae forward and none gave in to it. Flora waited in the vanguard as the Thistle pumped out wave after wave of war scent, but the orchard was silent.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The bees waited. Murmurs began. Perhaps the wasps had gone. The bees’ wings were crushed, the heat was rising, and a tide of irritation seeped through the crowd. And then—a hard beat of acid air rushed in and every sister’s feet felt the heavy, alien vibration as a great wasp settled on the landing board. There was the sound of a hard scuffle and then a crack. A Thistle guard screamed, then another. Standing right at the front, Flora saw it all.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wasp was a huge female with bands of acid yellow and glossy black. Her head was as large as three sisters’ and she used her slashing claws to catch the guards one by one, killing each with a snap of her heavy jaws. Then she flattened her long antennae, crouched down, and peered inside the hive.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Spasms of fear shot through the bees at the sight of her glittering, malevolent eyes, but not one of them moved. Flora stared back at the wasp and felt her dagger slide out again. The wasp smiled at her.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Pretty, pretty . . .” She drove a whip of her acid scent down the passageway; it wrapped around the antennae of dozens of bees and made them yelp in anger and disgust. She pushed her huge face closer, blocking the light.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Greetings,” she hissed softly, “my sweet, juicy cousins.” Her claw flashed into the hive, close enough for Flora to see the entrails on its tip and smell the Thistles’ blood. To stop herself from running she dug her claws deeper into the comb. Deep within the hive, a faint vibration pulsed toward her. It spoke in her mind.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Keep still. Hold firm and wait.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora gripped harder into the wax and held the wasp’s stare. The wasp gazed softly into her eyes, willing her closer. The scent of malice rose stronger.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Draw her in,</span> spoke the thought in Flora’s mind. <span class="italic">Lure her, lure her—</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora stepped backward and all her sisters moved with her. The vibration in the comb became stronger and they felt it too. She kept her gaze locked with the wasp’s.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Lure her. Draw her.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora let her antennae tremble and the wasp pushed in closer.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Are you the one, shall it be you?” Her voice had a soft singsong cadence, but her gaze was hard and calculating. “What a fat feast you will make, little cousin . . .” The wasp eased herself deeper into the hive entrance, and Flora could not hold in her fear, for her sisters were dense behind her and there was no retreat from mortal combat.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wasp’s body rasped on the hive floor. Four of her six elbows were in, and the only light was the yellow striping of her face. Flora dug down into the wax again but the voice in her mind had stopped. She would be the first to die, but she would fight for her sisters’ lives—for Holy Mother’s life. She unlatched her wings and heard the sound of every sister doing the same.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“No,” the wasp crooned, pulling her last pair of legs into the hive. “We should not fight; all I want is to take you to meet the chillldren, all the hungry . . . little . . . <span class="italic">children—</span>” A claw slashed out and she laughed. “Forgive me, you’re too delicious.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">DRAW HER.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">The voice was clear and strong in Flora’s mind. She whimpered and backed away, and the wasp crawled in after her. The smell was suffocating and her soft hissing struck terror into Flora’s body. She felt that all her sisters had crept around the edges and their numbers had filled from the back. There was no more room to move. The monster gathered herself to spring.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">NOW!</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora roared the word as the wasp lunged—and sprang upon the monster’s back, her claws scrabbling for purchase on the slippery armor.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wasp hissed and writhed in a frenzy of rage, one sister after another shrieking as she snapped their heads in her jaws and ripped their bellies with her claws. Flora fought her way up to the wasp’s head and the lashing black whips of the creature’s antennae. She caught one in her mouth and bit down.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wasp hissed and hurled herself against the walls, trying to crush her attacker against them. Flora clung on and spat the foul blood as below her sisters threw themselves at the thrashing foe. Then Flora lunged for the other antenna, cracking it off the wasp’s head so that the hole jetted pulses of green blood. Blinded in agony, the wasp screamed in rage, killing sister after sister, but she was one against many and the tide of bees kept coming until the stinging, biting weight of their bodies covered her and held her down and she could not move.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Then they beat their wings, fast and tight with fury so that the air heated until they themselves could barely breathe. The wasp was strong and kept struggling, but she grew weaker, and then she stopped. Only when her smell changed and the bees heard the dull cracking of her shell from the heat did they cease their fanning.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The great wasp lay dead, and so did hundreds of brave sisters closest to her, killed by the colossal heat. Many others were maimed in the fight, and outside on the landing board, fallen Thistle sisters lay dead or mutilated in the sun. The air was thick with the foul scent of the wasps and the blood of bees, but the hive was saved.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE DEAD WASP</span> was a horrific sight. The great glittering black eyes were cooked white, and two green blebs of blood marked the roots of her antennae. Herself unhurt, Flora began to help her wounded sisters. More bees came running from all areas of the hive with vials of holy propolis to bind up the broken shells of any who might live, but the casualties were very great.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora carried many sisters out to the sunny landing board and laid them down gently, knowing they would not return. Many lay in agony with their limbs crushed. Flora stopped to comfort one, a sturdy little Plantain whose face was half gone. Many Sage priestesses moved among the dying to bless them with the Queen’s Love and ease their passing. One Sage in particular caught Flora’s attention, the sun bright in her pale fur. The priestess turned to look, and by the power of her gaze, Flora knew they had met before. Quickly she walked back into the hive, to the group of sanitation workers gathered at the wasp’s body.</p>
<p class="x1BM">They were wild-eyed and terrified of the huge carcass, until Flora spat out a mouthful of its blood and grabbed one of its legs. It broke away from the body as she pulled it, and the sanitation workers roared in approval. No longer afraid, they fell upon the wasp, tearing what was left of her to pieces and carrying them out. Then, because the scent of the battle was broadcast on the air far and wide, the remaining Thistle guards let them hurl the pieces over the edge of the board, no longer fastidious.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Bees of all kin scrubbed away at the landing board to rid it of the wasp’s foul smell, and as each section was cleared the priestesses passed along the edge and laid new markers to cleanse and reconsecrate the hive. Sisters looked for dead of their own kin, then the priestesses stood wing to wing and sang the Holy Chord as even the timid house bees came forward to fly the dead to the burial area. Flora searched too, but no sanitation worker had fallen.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Your kin does not fight.” It was Sister Sage, the pale priestess who had taken Flora first to the Nursery, and then the detention cell. “But you did, and bravely. Why did you not run back inside?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“The voice in my head.” Flora felt no fear. “It told me what to do.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage looked at her for a long time.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“That was the Hive Mind. It has also restored your tongue.” The priestess touched her antennae to Flora’s, and once again the divine fragrance of the Queen’s Love filled her soul. “You are indeed unusual.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Is my Holy Mother safe?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“More questions . . . Yes, she is. And it is our ancient law that no matter what her kin, any sister who channels the Hive Mind in times of crisis may be taken to meet her. If, of course, she survives. It appears you have.” She clapped her hands together, and six beautiful young bees arrived at her side. All wore fresh veils of the Queen’s Love, which made their faces iridescent.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Behold the Queen’s ladies-in-waiting. Go with them, and attend them well.”</p>
