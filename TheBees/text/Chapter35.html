<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">O</span><span class="smallCaps">UTSIDE THE</span> D<span class="smallCaps">ANCE</span> H<span class="smallCaps">ALL HUNDREDS OF BEES BUSTLED</span> across the coded mosaic of the lobby. Motionless, all her senses trained on locating the odor of sickness again, Flora stood in their midst searching for it—but it had vanished into the scent tapestry of the hive. Using all her skills from foraging, she summoned back a trace of its elusive molecular structure.</p>
<p class="x1BM">It aped a flower, with a top note sweet like petals, but its disguise lacked definition. Foragers would not pursue it for it had no smell of food—and sanitation workers would ignore it, for its superficial sweetness held it apart from the smells of hive waste.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The sound of incoming foragers’ engines broke Flora’s concentration, then a group of young receivers ran past toward the landing board, kin-scents streaming in excitement. By the time their wake had cleared so had every last atom of the scent, as if it had its own intelligence and was evading capture.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Frustrated, Flora ran up to the midlevel of the hive. At this time of day the worker dormitories would be unused, and there, in relative stillness, she could try to revive the data before its essential nature faded. To her surprise, as soon as she entered the main lobby, the scent revealed itself again. Its thin, twisting core was the same, but under its superficial floral disguise, it was changing. It was beginning to copy the scent of the comb itself—and when it succeeded, it would become undetectable.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Not caring about the risk to herself, Flora sucked the odor into her spiracles as hard as she could. Every instinct told her this was the foulest kind of impurity, gathering strength every second as it adapted itself to the bouquet of the hive. Soon its faint, twisting core of corruption would diffuse so completely that every sister would naturally breathe it—and each body become host to its foul purpose.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora concentrated all her strength on the hidden core structure. It was the merest thread of corruption, as if she flew high above some long-dead creature—but it grew stronger as she approached the dormitory. Ready to encounter some wretched sister festering in a corner, Flora burst through the doors and ran between the rows of berths searching for her—but all were empty and clean.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The trail of scent had vanished again—except for a few molecules clinging to the blank wax of a dormitory wall. Flora raised her antennae and felt all over for hidden panels and entry tiles—but the walls were plain and true, laced only with the kin-scent of honest sisters’ bodies.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora ran back out into the lobby. She stood between Pollen and Patisserie, the Chapel of Wax, and the entrance to the Drones’ Arrival Hall, now completely repaired and smelling strongly of the new propolis carvings. Inside was the usual fuss as a new drone was helped from his emergence chamber, and she sealed her spiracles against the cloudy pheromones before they could distract her. Ahead were the big double doors of the Category Two Nursery, and a faint, peculiar odor hung about them, but it was stale and not the live and wily scent she hunted.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Like the humblest sanitation worker searching for the next load to clear, Flora knelt and touched her antennae to the gutter. The voices of her sisters and the pulsing in the floor-codes fell away. One faint scent remained—the sickness. If she tried to grab it with her conscious brain it slipped away, but if she breathed it in softly, she could advance on it. As if turning for home at the end of a distant forage, Flora switched all instinct to her inner compass, and began to walk.</p>
<p class="x1BM">She did not know where she went, nor did she rouse herself from the semitrance she moved in. She was only dimly aware of her sisters’ exclamations as they swerved away, or that her antennae twitched in pain as she burst through every scent-gate in her path. She walked on, closing on the foul scent that ate its way through one more beautiful.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Something struck against Flora’s chest and stopped her. Six identical Sage priestesses blocked her way, each dressed in high ceremonial robes. A dark group of police stood behind them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“What is your business?” the priestesses asked in their choral voice.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I—am from Sanitation. I search for the source of sickness.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">They gazed at Flora, fast tremors running up their antennae as their minds conferred.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“So it is true.” The single voice of a priestess was full of sadness. “And we can wait no longer.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Her words struck at Flora’s heart, for now she recognized where she was, a place she had not seen since her eviction by Lady Burnet’s jealous will. She stood at the beautiful carved doors to the Queen’s Chambers again—and pressing against them from within, like a demonic cloud, was the odor she tracked.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“No!” she screamed. “Not Holy Mother!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The priestesses pulled her back. The police raised a harsh veil of their own scent before them and smashed open the Queen’s doors.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="smallCaps">Every bee stopped</span> on the threshold. The fertility police buzzed their alarms but did not move. The priestesses uttered one cry. Flora’s antennae stood rigid as the full horror drove into her brain.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Spilled goblets and broken cakes lay scattered on the comb and Her Majesty the Queen sat amid them, her lace mantle of wings spread all around covering her body. Her face was as beautiful as ever, but her scent had changed. Coiling through the divine fragrance of her Love, air worms of the malign odor grew stronger with every pulse of her heart.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Disheveled and wide-eyed with fear, the Queen’s ladies-in-waiting reached out to the fertility police. Their wings curled shriveled on their backs like dead half-eaten things, and when they tried to speak no sound came out, for their tongues had turned to slime.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Who comes to us so rudely?” The Queen lifted her head and scanned the chamber. “Who would disturb us in our labors?” As she rearranged her mantle they all saw the dead baby cradled in her arms.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“No, Mother—” Flora wanted to run to her but the fertility police held her firm.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Queen turned her sightless eyes in Flora’s direction. “Let our daughter come.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Forgive us, Your Majesty, but it is you who must now come to your daughters.” The priestesses knelt.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“But we are nursing our child.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Through the foul odor, a trace of pure Devotion rose from the Queen’s body, and carried the beauty of her voice. Every bee in the chamber yearned toward it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Forgive me, Mother,” Flora sobbed.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Queen turned her blind head.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Darling child,” she said, “hush your tears.” She beckoned to where her ladies lay, and one of them crawled toward her, her kin-scent devoured by her sickness. “Take our new son,” said the Queen. “Take him back to the Nursery.” As she passed the dead baby it fell apart, and the lady-in-waiting moaned in horror.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Come, Majesty,” said the Sage priestesses. “We must go at once.” They threw out a cordon of their powerful astringent scent, and the Queen rose and walked through it toward the big carved doors. Her ladies began to crawl after her, but the fertility police blocked them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Forgive us.” They twisted each one’s head from her thorax. Then they turned to Flora. “Come.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="smallCaps">Every task was</span> <span class="smallCaps">halted</span> as the Hive Mind summoned all sisters. The passageways were filled with silent bees hurrying to the Dance Hall, crystals of propolis, flakes of fresh wax, or half-chewed pollen dough clinging to their fur. Marching within her escort of fertility police, Flora saw some of her own kin throw her agonized looks of fear.</p>
<p class="x1BM">As they went into the Dance Hall the bees coughed at the great wall of masking scent in the center of the floor, then fell silent at the sight of the Queen behind it. Her mantle glowed bright through the strange energy waves coiling around her, and pure threads of her divine fragrance still rose above it all. She smiled at them, and even through their fear, each bee felt her Mother’s Love embrace her. Then the Hive Mind spoke.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Behold the sacred Rule of Law.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">A whole fresh leaf was carried in by more of the fertility police, and on it was a thick gold layer of forsythia pollen. By the sheen of each grain, it was clear that it had been prepared the day before, and the foragers sought each other’s eyes in silent question, for none had been part of this.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora alone knew it. <span class="italic">The Golden Leaf.</span> The fifth story in the Queen’s Library. The flickering fear in her belly hardened into a tight knot as from the back of the chamber, the Sage priestesses walked forward.</p>
<p class="x1BM">At their approach the Queen lifted her wings and the bees murmured in relief and awe, for at first they shone bright—but then ragged spots of darkness appeared in them as the sickness crawled upon her. As the Queen’s wings began to disappear, the Sage priestesses made a crescent around her, and the bees began to weep.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Queen raised her blind head.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“By what power am I called hither?” Her beautiful voice was unchanged. “I would know by what authority, I mean lawful.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Then the Hive Mind spoke.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">THE QUEEN SICKENS.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">All the priestesses knelt, and all the bees in the chamber and those listening motionless throughout the hive did the same. The Queen alone stood firm.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“But our Love still shines—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Holy Mother, sovereign of our hive, forgive us,” intoned one priestess, her voice transmitting through every cell of the comb, “for it is our most grave and somber duty to announce your reign has ended.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Ended?”</span> The Queen laughed, and held her belly. “How can that be, when I hold the future of our hive? Within me are eggs for countless generations.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“And each one tainted by the sickness you bear, which spreads affliction through our home. We have found it out; it is confirmed. Let the witness be called.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Police officers pushed Flora forward. The Queen drew in her scent.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“My reading daughter. . . . Are we in my Library?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Forgive me, Mother,” Flora sobbed. “I have betrayed you—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Ah . . .” The Queen turned her antennae toward the pollen-coated leaf. “Now I remember . . . we come to the fifth story. And I to death, for I know how it ends.” Then her face shone and light glowed back into her magnificent wings. “Let all my children come to me—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“No. It is time.” The Sage spoke together.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“But I wish to bless my daughters—I am Immortal Holy Mother—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You were.” The Sage signaled and the fertility police seized the Queen and forced her to her knees. “Your reign has ended.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Every sister felt a terrible tearing pain inside her, yet could not look away as the police dragged the Queen’s mantle from her body. She did not protest, even at the long, high ripping sound of the beautiful membranes tearing. Sister Inspector stepped forward, her huge claw ready.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Not you.” The Queen’s voice carried on the still air. “Let it be a noble Thistle.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">All eyes in the chamber went to the priestesses. They were utterly still. Then Sister Sage beckoned back Sister Inspector. She pointed to a large Thistle at the front.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Stricken, the Thistle shook her head. “I—I cannot. I cannot!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Queen nodded. “Bravely now, daughter,” she said. “If ever you have loved me.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Thistle stepped forward, and every sister’s body clenched in terror at her task. The Queen stretched out her ragged wings and bent her head.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I forgive you. Quick, belov—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">With one blow, the Thistle struck the Queen’s head from her body. It rolled on the comb and lay still. Its beautiful blind eyes gazed up at the vaulted ceiling, and blood seeped from her severed thorax. The Thistle stepped back, unable to believe what she had done. Flora’s belly drew so tight she could not breathe.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The silence in the Dance Hall tightened around the bees until they choked, and the scent of the Queen’s blood rose up around them. Then as one they shrieked and wailed their agony and rent their wings.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">What have we done!</span> sobbed the Hive Mind. <span class="italic">We have murdered Mother! What have we done!</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">They rushed to the Queen’s body and beat their antennae on the comb in their anguish, and many tore their own fur out in clumps. Alarm glands flooded across the thundering comb, the air throbbed with the Queen’s Love and the scent of her blood, and every priestess was surrounded by a wall of convulsing bees.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora too ran through the crowd screaming her agony, for each bee had watched the act without resistance, and each felt guilty. Only the Thistle executioner stood rigid in shock—and the fertility police, standing behind the patient priestesses.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Gradually the comb stopped drumming, and the Hive Mind sank dazed and exhausted back into the bodies of the bees. Flora raised her antennae. The odor of sickness was gone. Other bees began to know it too, standing to scent the changed air. It was clean, and it filled with kin-scent of the Sage. A priestess stepped forward.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Our hive is freed from sickness. And as the Queen’s body failed, the holy power of fertility passed to the Melissae, her priestesses. All assembled hear now in public that we exercise our Divine Right to raise a princess from pure Sage stock—for we are the kin of queens. In three days’ time, a new Queen shall rise and usher in a new golden age of summer and of plenty.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The comb began to tremble and the Hive Mind spoke.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">BY TRADITION, BY KIN, BY DIVINE RIGHT,</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">ONLY THE SAGE MAY RULE!</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Faces shining, open wings radiant with light, the Sage priestesses looked out over the crowd. The Hive Mind repeated the words so that no bee held any other thought.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">BY DIVINE RIGHT, ONLY THE SAGE MAY RULE!</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">“Merciful sisters!” The Thistle executioner’s loud cry broke the spell. The bees turned to see her on her knees in the Queen’s blood. “Kill me,” she begged. “I cannot live with my sin—I must die!” She held up her blood-wet hands.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Behold,” called out Sister Sage. “Behold the suffering of our noble sister Thistle. Blessed be the sister who takes away our sin.” She signaled, and Sister Inspector stepped up behind the Thistle, then twisted her head round so that the crack echoed in the air of the Dance Hall.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“And so are we absolved.” Sister Sage raised her wings, and six Sage priestesses walked forward with the pollen-coated leaf and laid it down beside the dead Queen.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“A Queen cannot rise in three days!” cried out another voice. “How long have you planned this?” It was a Teasel, standing in the center of a group of her kin.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Every priestess turned her antennae on the group—but the Teasel kept theirs high in defiance. A bright channel of air crackled between them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Our sisters Teasel, of the Nursery.” Sister Sage nodded slowly. “It is right and proper you should ask, for matters of hive health and security have ever been our kin’s gravest concern. Long have we dreaded this dark day.” She raised her wings higher and addressed the farthest reaches of the Dance Hall. “The Teasel say we have prepared, and they are right. A queenless hive is a prize for the Myriad, and to raise a princess is the state secret and holy burden we have borne in silence, until now.” Sister Sage raised her wings proudly.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Know you, all sisters gathered here, that we the Melissae, keepers of the Holy Law, protect you with our foresight, for to save our hive from queenless peril, we have made ready a princess for this moment.” Then the priestess bowed low to the group of Teasels. “We thank our sisters Teasel for acknowledging our great and sacred responsibility. We ask no more of them.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Then the comb trembled and the Hive Mind spoke again.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">In three days’ time a new Queen will rise.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">ACCEPT, OBEY, AND SERVE.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">With great ceremony, the six priestesses lifted the Queen’s head, then her body, onto the leaf bier. The Holy Chord rose from the wax comb up into the bees’ bodies, and the sisters wept again as the pallbearers carried their royal burden through. Some sisters rushed behind them out of the Dance Hall, while others staggered, and yet more stood paralyzed with the horror, their eyes fixed where the Queen had fallen. All the Thistle remained, beating their antennae on the comb in shame. The Teasel watched it all, then left together.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora stood gasping for breath, antennae pulsing from the horror she had witnessed and the Minerva spider’s words echoing in her mind.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Unimaginable horrors . . .</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">If she had died in the cage of glass, she would not have traced the sickness to the Queen, who would still be alive. But then—the sickness would have spread to every sister. The pain in Flora’s belly twisted harder, but even as she sank to her knees and wept, a part of her mind took her back to the Queen’s Library, where there was still one more panel to be told.</p>
