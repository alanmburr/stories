<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">T</span><span class="smallCaps">HE OLD ORCHARD STOOD BESIEGED</span>. T<span class="smallCaps">O ONE SIDE SPREAD</span> a vast, arable plain, a dullard’s patchwork of corn and soy reaching to the dark tree line of the hills. To the other, a light-industrial development stretched toward the town.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Between the dripping trees the remains of a path still showed. A man in early middle age kicked at the tall nettles and docks to widen it. Neat in her navy business suit, a younger woman followed. She paused to take some photographs with her phone.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I hope you don’t mind, but we’ve put out some feelers, and we’re already beating them off with sticks. Prime brownfield location.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The man stared through the trees, not listening.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“There—thought for a moment it had vanished.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">An old wooden beehive stood camouflaged against the trees. The woman drew back.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I won’t come any closer,” she said. “I’m a bit funny about insects.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“So’s my father. He calls them his girls.” The man looked up at the low gray sky. “Is that more rain? What happened to summer?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The woman glanced up from her phone. “I know! I’ve forgotten what blue sky looks like. Must be hard with the kids out of school.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“They barely notice. They’re always online.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">He walked forward and peered closer at the hive.</p>
<p class="x1BM">A few bees emerged from a small hole at the bottom. They walked along a narrow wooden ledge and hummed their wings.</p>
<p class="x1BM">He watched them for a while, then turned back to her. “I’m sorry. Now is not the right time.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Oh!” She put her phone away. “Have you—changed your mind?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">He shook his head.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“No. I’ll sell . . .” He cleared his throat. “But not yet. It feels wrong.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Of course.” She hesitated. “I suppose it’s very hard to know approximately . . . ?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Could be months. Could be tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The woman allowed a respectful silence.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Well, rest assured that when you <span class="italic">are</span> ready, it’s a seller’s market.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">She began walking back along the path.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The man stood alone by the hive. On impulse he put his palm against the wood, as if feeling for a pulse. Then he turned and followed her.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Behind them, bees rose into the brightening air.</p>
