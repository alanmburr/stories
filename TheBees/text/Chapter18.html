<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">T</span><span class="smallCaps">HE BREAK IN THE WEATHER DID NOT LAST</span>. A <span class="smallCaps">SHARP</span> east wind drove heavy rains over the hills and down across the valley, and many sisters were lost that day. Heeding the early warning from Lily 500’s barometric data, Flora made it back with a scant last load of willowherb pollen and, because there were no ready receivers, took it herself to Pollen and Patisserie. The desperate gratitude of the yellow-dusted sisters baking there made her determined to go out again, but on her return to the board the Thistle guards stood barring all further flights.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You are too valuable to lose,” one said, with her kin’s awkward jocularity. Flora forced a smile and watched the air as the last few returning foragers managed to land in the rain. All were bedraggled with badly torn wings, some had broken antennae, and they crowded into the corridor to let the receivers salvage what they could from their sodden pollen panniers.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Then exhausted sisters went not to the Dance Hall, but to find a berth for their final sleep. Other foragers touched them as they passed and murmured the salute <span class="italic">Praise end your days, Sister.</span> The pain eased from the wounded sisters’ faces and their beauty shone, for to die like this in honor and safety was every forager’s hope.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora joined one of the many fanning details set about the hive due to the cold, damp air. First she used her great wing-power in the lobbies, moving when the shift changed to let exhausted house bees rest their weaker bodies, and then when the emergency message flashed through the floor tiles, she went up to the Fanning Hall. A leak in the roof was letting in moisture and sisters rushed to make a chain of their bodies and pass beads of presoftened propolis to seal it. Mold spores had been found on some of the highest honey vaults and every kin but the sanitation workers were called to the fanning rotas, even the Thistles. They came in from the landing board, for no predators attacked a wet hive, and they fanned hard and fast as if heating a wasp to death. Even drones came in to watch, admiring the sisters’ agile antics and calling at frequent intervals for refreshments to be brought to them, as it was a tiring sight to behold.</p>
<p class="x1BM">By the end of the day the rain was still strong, and the spirits of the sisters—the foragers especially—had grown weak. The smell of damp fur and high kin odors filled the hive and every sister’s wings were limp and crumpled from the ceaseless running to and fro to fan or carry. All were desperate for a long, ecstatic service of Devotion. When it came, the comb shivered and the fragrance poured forth, but the beating of the rain or the pressure of the sky had affected the transmission, and the bees struggled to find their natural state of Oneness and Love.</p>
<p class="x1BM">By the second morning the foragers were irritable as they turned back from the drenched landing board; the sanitation workers smelled even stronger as they carried the night’s dead to the morgue; and in the cold damp canteens the food had lost much savor. Devotions came and went, crowded, humid, and silent as each sister concentrated on restoring her own spiritual harmony.</p>
<p class="x1BM">By the third day, the streaming bars of rain locked the hive into cabin fever. Bales of waste accumulated in the freight depot, and some frustrated foragers refused to accept the law and flew out to their deaths. The Thistle reinforced their presence in the approach corridor to stop further waste of worker resources.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Selfish,” other bees said when they heard. “More work for the rest.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">After the fanning and the cleaning there was nothing to do but talk, and gossip bred like mold in the damp confinement. Nothing was off-limits as the sisters struggled to find occupation for their constant restless energy; every kin was discussed by every other, the décor of the hive and its state of repair, the food, the standard of hygiene—even the Queen’s laying.</p>
<p class="x1BM">This last topic, which could have been the death warrant of any who spoke of it disparagingly, was always discussed in fulsome terms. Every bee knew a Nursery worker or had recently been one herself, and every bee had her own most personal relationship with Holy Mother. They compared their feelings during and after Devotion, and there was more than a little competition over who felt her Love most strongly, for ecstasy was piety. The conversations always concluded with the acknowledgment that Her Majesty continued to lay at magnificent speed and volume and was more beautiful than ever, and as she was the mightiest force in the universe, this rain must be a sign of her displeasure, and so they must all work harder. <span class="italic">Accept, Obey, and Serve.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora said the words too, half devout and half ashamed. Her body surged with unused energy and, despite the deepening tear in one wing membrane, she longed to fly to escape the terrible tension of confinement, not only with her sisters but with her own thoughts. Keeping her antennae shut at all times was a terrible strain, for it meant she could hardly rest at night lest she dream in scent of her egg. It was pointless to lie there in guilt, unable to sleep and occupying a premium rest chamber some more worthy sister might take, so like many other forager sisters who could not sleep because of their confinement, she got up and wandered the corridors.</p>
<p class="x1BM">On her way to the landing board to check conditions, Flora paused to peer into the Drones’ Hall. It was a squalid sight. The long days of inactivity had made many drones corpulent, the floor was filthy, and the sisters tending them did so with a disconsolate air, more interested in the falling crumbs than on praising Their Malenesses. The curling, pungent pheromones of the males cut through the stifling smell of ten thousand damp sisters and Flora went in to breathe more. To her surprise many other sisters were also there and she saw from their faces that they too breathed the drones’ scent as some relief from the unventilated female fug of the dormitories.</p>
<p class="x1BM">A strange atmosphere hung in the large chamber. In their boredom and hunger some sisters took liberties with the drones’ food and drink, and in return the drones took liberties with the sisters’ bodies, touching them idly while speaking to each other of princesses they would seize when the rain ceased.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora withdrew, a strange feeling stirring in her body. Without realizing it, her antennae channels had spread wide open and she drew great, deep breaths through all her spiracles. When she tried to draw them shut she found they were stuck, and a spasm shot through her whole body. Her belly swelled warm and tight and a tiny vibration flickered deep within her abdomen.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora hurried away from the Drones’ Hall renewed in terror and in joy that her crime would come again. In the empty lobby outside the Dance Hall she paused to scent the air from the landing board. The orchard was sweet and cool in the rising dawn, and the rain had almost stopped. The comb began to thrum as the hive awoke and the multitude of sisters began moving. Once desperate to be out on the wing, Flora no longer wanted to forage, only to be still and breathe sweet wax.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The egg in her belly glowed brighter inside her like a tiny sun. As the first foragers came down the main staircase Flora ran up a smaller one, to the midlevel. Soon she would lay, and in secret. In order to survive, her egg must have a pure wax crib—but she could not risk going to the Nursery.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora hesitated in the midlevel lobby, pretending to pore over the mosaic codes with the other sisters checking which area first required their services. She could smell the Nursery cribs from where she stood, only ever made of the purest new wax that came from the hallowed and restricted chapel. To prevent the risk of accidental contamination, the entrance was always veiled from full public scent and impossible to find with the naked eye.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Checking to make sure that there were no Sage priestesses or police in the vicinity, Flora unlocked her antennae to locate the Chapel of Wax. Immediately, her love for her egg rushed upon her and she felt her kin-scent rising warm and strong. Someone must smell her, would seize her—but all she felt were the pulsing prayer tiles beneath her feet, for she was already on the path. A purifying scent shimmered across the plain wax doors ahead, and parted at her approach. The doors swung open.</p>
