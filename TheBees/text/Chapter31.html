<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">I</span><span class="smallCaps">T TOOK A MOMENT FOR</span> F<span class="smallCaps">LORA TO SEE</span> S<span class="smallCaps">IR</span> L<span class="smallCaps">INDEN, SITTING</span> hunched and small at the foot of a broken Treasury wall. The sight of him made her glad.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I could have shown myself at any time before this,” he said, “and met a quick end. Now I must die of starvation, like the coward I am.” He looked up. “Unless I call out for someone to come and finish me off.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Do not disturb their rest. Where did you hide?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“In plain scent—I joined your work party: look.” And Sir Linden pulled his antennae in short and blunt, hunched his back, and dropped his head. Even his wings seemed lower set. He scuttled from side to side, his gait quick and anxious like a sanitation worker’s. “I think they smelled the difference, but of course none could speak it. Or perhaps . . . fool that I am . . . I thought them kind enough to allow it.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">They both looked up at the Cluster. Flora hesitated.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“There is room up there, among us. At least you would be warm.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Oh, yes, one’s own blood flowing freely from one’s wounds is very warming, for a short while anyway. Do you think me crazy?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“The bloodlust is past. No one will hurt you now.” Flora began to climb back up the Treasury walls.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Wait.” Linden followed her, his movements weak. “Could it work? Why would you do this for me? You are unnatural. Though that is not news.” As he drew level with her he tried to puff his thorax. “Yes, thank you. I agree to your plan,” he whispered, “but surely my noble groin will draw great interest? Some sister will long to groom it—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You will be quite safe.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Good,” he whispered back, “for my popularity fatigued me in the Season, you know. Very greatly.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE SANITATION WORKERS</span> hung silent in their latticed sleep. Flora signaled Sir Linden to wait while very gently she unhooked a couple of sisters, then she beckoned to him. They murmured and stirred as she joined him between them. He grimaced as he sniffed them, then entwined his arms and legs.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Still quite a strong-scented bunch, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Be glad of it.” Flora let a wave of her own scent cover him. “And be quiet.” She trod on him as she climbed up one level of hanging sisters.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Wait—where are you going?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You talk too much.” After her journey to the Fanning Hall floor Flora was glad of her sisters’ warmth. Carefully she squeezed herself back into position and the scent of the Queen stole up through the slow-breathing Cluster. She waited until she was sure her sisters’ scent covered that of the drone, then a weary peace soaked through her body, and at last she slept.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE</span> C<span class="smallCaps">LUSTER MOVED VERY SLOWLY,</span> the great mass revolving on itself to travel the Treasury walls, and the sisters did not wake, only stirred in their sleep as they shifted their grip on legs and hands, rising or sinking as the Cluster turned. When the great ball shifted again, the smell of honey spiked hunger in Flora’s belly, strong as when she broke out of her emergence chamber. Her whole body felt empty and trembling—and when she saw how far she was from her turn to eat, she wanted to wail in despair. There were maybe another thousand mouths to feed before the turn of the sanitation workers—if they had strength to wait.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Her limbs ached from holding her position, but all around her the other floras slept on, as did the strange new sister she had joined into them. Flora did not want to wake them, but she could not bear to remain like this. She drew in her consciousness and tried to pull shreds of the divine fragrance around her antennae to soothe her impatience. There was not enough and the effort only exacerbated her need for food or escape from this dark, crowded confinement. Other foragers were also awake—she could feel their frustration pulsing through the Cluster. She pushed more energy into her senses—the air had changed and the wood of the hive smelled different. It was drier, and the wind had subsided. Very softly, Flora unhooked herself.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE VIEW FROM THE LANDING BOARD</span> was a shock. The orchard raked black branches against a white sky, and beyond it raw brown fields stretched to the high and distant tree line. Several foragers stretched their cramped limbs and looked at each other. All were ravenous. They shivered as they raised their antennae and scented the cold air. There was no wind or rain, and a pale haze in the cloud showed the sun still lived. One by one they started their engines. The sound was loud and unnervingly different in the winter air. There were no Thistle guards to do it, so each of the foragers laid down her own homecoming marker to guide them all back in. Flora watched them. A Calluna forager nodded to her in approval.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You have the right.” Her voice was cracked and dry, and Flora could hear how empty her belly was. “And your kin-scent is so strong—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“None of us could ever miss it!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Do it, Sister.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">For the first time in her life, Flora laid her kin-scent down on the landing board, proclaiming her kin could forage. The homecoming marker immediately absorbed the new chemical signature and it rose up more strongly. The sisters started their engines.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora’s wings were weak from their long time folded and the cold air shocked her as she struggled for altitude. Every scent and air current had changed, and the smell of the warehouses was stronger. Her antennae suddenly flashed with an incoming message—and to her delight she recognized the unique frequency of Lily 500’s data running in her brain. A foraging location, with coordinates over the town.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Cage of glass, cage of glass,</span> were the only words attached. Flora had no idea what it meant, but the coordinates were so insistent that she began her descent over the houses and their dirty green patchwork of gardens.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wind grew stronger, and with it, the cold. Each pump of blood to her wings took more fuel than before, and a lightness in her crop signaled danger. Her pride again, insisting she would find forage in the hardest conditions, in the farthest fields. Now she would have to chase the sun’s dropping azimuth home without refueling—</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Cage of glass,</span> insisted Lily’s data in her brain, <span class="italic">cage of glass!</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">“Be quiet! Be quiet!” Flora whirled in the air, her energy level sending a warning to her brain. If she touched cold ground now it would suck the last of it from her body and she would never rise again.</p>
<p class="x1BM">She caught a trace of sweetness—bright and young and pure. A flower—a young, beautiful flower. Flora locked onto it. Fragrant beyond buddleia, iris, or even honeysuckle, a thread of the sweetest fragrance curled from a cube of light against the side of a building. Flora veered away from her reflection before she crashed into the huge window.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Inside the cage of glass were plants, some bright and luscious of petal, some tiny and white. The sweet scent she followed was inside, coming from a flower calling to her, imploring any bee, any pollinator to come in—but Flora did not know how to enter. The wind dragged her along the glass wall and she caught the scent more strongly. It came from a little gap halfway down.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE AIR IN THE CONSERVATORY</span> was warm and humid, and the plants did not grow out of the earth but from brightly colored pots on stands and on ledges along the walls. A metal dish of mashed meat was on the ground and several flies fed from it, but more lay dead or dying on the windowsills and on the floor. Flora ignored everything but the beautiful plant calling to her with its pure, sweet scent, open and untouched and longing for a bee.</p>
<p class="x1BM">First she had to avoid the drunken bluebottles contaminating all the bigger flowers. Many alighted on the heavy orange lily heads still waiting to open, drawn by the thick bead of nectar showing at the ruched tip of the petals. Other flowers also waited, and Flora did not know if they were ready, for their petals were fleshy and green like peapods, their pursed and meaty red lips edged with strange white tendrils like fangs. Feeling her wingbeats they murmured lasciviously to her and pushed their murky perfume across her path, but they held no appeal.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Amid their lewd clamor rose the one true scent that called to Flora, the virgin bloom of a little orange tree, a tortured miniature graft of three different plants. Its tiny ultraviolet florets shone in the dull winter air, and she felt its desire for her straining from its roots.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Hush, hush.” Flora pushed her own scent through her feet as she settled on the dark, glossy leaves. The plant’s citrus sweetness immediately brightened her senses and the fatigue of her journey fell away. There was not one other bee in the glass room, and Flora’s panniers opened in readiness for the haul of pollen and nectar she would surely be able to take back to the hive from this marvelous place. She climbed up and positioned herself over one of the creamy white florets, and the contact of her feet on the flower’s virginal petal made them both tremble. Flora held it softly, then sank her tongue into its depths. The exquisite taste sparkled through her mind and body like sun on water, and she drank until each floret was empty.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Behind her, the green-fleshed flowers waited their turn. As Flora combed the minute gold pollen beads of the orange blossom into her panniers, she felt their patient desire. When she looked again, their green lips had parted to show a glimpse of inner red, and their white fringing had a more festive look. Their thick coarse nectar could not compare with the near-divine bouquet of the orange blossom, but it was plentiful, and the way it rose to her attention was very flattering.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Despite herself, Flora’s own scent pulsed more strongly from her body. So strong was these flowers’ desire for her that they actually moved toward her, their inner petals moistening under her gaze. Flora hovered, mesmerized by their lust.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Come to me instead,” crooned a high voice. Flora looked up to see a big black Minerva spider sitting in her hazy cobweb. “What a sweet servant. Come let me hold you.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I have seen your kind,” Flora called back. “No thank you.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Her wings beat harder with the adrenaline of spider-danger, exciting more thick perfume to rise from the green-fleshed flowers. Perhaps they were a kind of weed. In these conditions sisters would drink spurge if they could find it, and it would be a fine thing to go back with a cropful of fresh nectar, no matter its provenance.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The fleshy blooms gaped wider, encouraging her decision. Who knew when the weather would permit another forage? Perhaps she could drink the orange blossom nectar herself, and then bring back this more plentiful one. Flora opened up her antennae channel a little more in case Lily 500 had any comment, but there was no signal of any kind.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The green flowers suddenly pumped their scent, flooding Flora’s brain and forcing her attention back to them. Their red mouths gaped wider, and on each inner lip stood three long white filaments like pistils or anthers, except they bore no pollen. The only nectar was a viscous slick at the join of the petals—crude but plentiful.</p>
<p class="x1BM">At the cloying smell, Flora hesitated. Shamelessly, the vulgar flowers begged for her touch, swelling even more nectar so that the thought rose in Flora’s mind that here was enough to feed the whole Cluster.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Before she could decide which bloom to choose, the air swarmed with flies driven wild by the same scent. Flora swerved out of the way as they buzzed crazily around the green flowers. The bluebottles shouted crude compliments and kicked at the white fringes with filthy feet to tease them. They swooped and swirled until the air twisted with the heavy perfume of the flowers and the carrion and excrement on the flies’ bodies. Some of them crashed into the bright glass and fell to the ground, stunned and buzzing. Irritated by their antics but mindful of the Minerva in the corner, Flora rose higher. The spider peered out between her sticky curtains.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Bee with secrets,” she whispered. “I can smell them from here.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora moved away but a jet from her alarm gland escaped her, and the spider laughed. “We will have some entertainment today, I think. First, watch the fools.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The flies taunted the green flowers, zooming close so that the petals gaped red, then screeching past without touching them. But the largest of the strange blooms had not forgotten Flora, and forced its fragrance up to her where she hovered.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“They always want you!” a bluebottle screamed at Flora as he tore past in the air, demented by the flowers’ smell. “But we are as good! Our very name tells you our skill: fly! We are lords of the air! Watch me!” His body was a metallic turquoise and he scrawled lines of obscene poetry in the air behind him. Flora felt dizzy watching him, and his smell made her sick, but his companions roared their approval.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The young fly tore through the air between Flora and the lusting green flower. He kicked along its white fringe with a filth-encrusted foot, and to Flora it looked as if the petal moved to touch him.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You must beg me!” he called to the flower as he spun loops in the air.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Oh, oh, sit with me and tell me your tales! Come here!” Excited by the bluebottle’s ravings, the Minerva clutched convulsively at the edge of her web.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We are as good as you!” he cried again, racing around Flora and chasing his own slipstream. “Though you despise us and call us Myriad—yet here we are, feeding at the same flowers!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Bee, honeybee,” the Minerva called to Flora, “drive the little shit-feeder up to me. He can tell his tales here.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Nectar!” screamed the bluebottle. “Only nectar now!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">He landed on a dull fat leaf near the green flowers. With his feces-encrusted feet and the remnants of some gory meal dried to his face, he looked pitiful and poor beside it. Beneath his clutching feet, the plant began to tighten in its own skin, filling and pumping its sap higher. The musk became dizzying and Flora settled on a ledge.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You make honey so you think you’re better,” the fly said to Flora, climbing higher toward the green-and-red flower, which slowly turned its petals to meet him. “But flowers love us too, and I have sucked so well from one that I learned its true name, <span class="italic">Euphorbia</span>. Do you believe me? It is true, no matter what you think.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The fly’s craving for respect made Flora angry. She understood why the Sage despised her own kin—because the flora were ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Stop cringing,” she said. “If you are a fly, you are a fly! Some of my people love spurge too—and I am the lowest of my kind. I clean waste—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Ha!” called the spider. “What do you expect, with your filthy foreign blood?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora fired her war gland at the spider. “I am Queenborn and hive hatched!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Fool, I meant your <span class="italic">father</span>. One of those fierce black wanderers from the far south.” The spider opened her mouth and picked at her fangs. “I’ll warrant no one steals <span class="italic">their</span> honey!” Her little eyes grew soft. “Your blood will be perfectly spiced . . .”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Ignore her.” The fly waved to distract Flora. “She can only get you if you let her.” He looked admiringly at Flora. “Do your people really drink spurge, like ours?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I know one.” Flora could not help smiling. “But my hive frowns on it.” She felt the intent gaze of the spider raking her wings, but she focused on the fly.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Thank you.” He bowed to her. Under their crust of filth, his legs were slim and well-turned and his thorax was iridescent blue-black and beautiful. “You are the first of your kind ever to speak to me.” He turned and walked up the stem to the green bloom.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Wait—” Flora cried out. “That plant—I do not know its name—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Nor do I, but I am thirsty, and it wants me.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Wait, boy!” A huge male bluebottle missing his wings ran along the window ledge. “I’ve told you—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“And every time, I live to drink again.” The young fly stepped onto the red inner skin of the flower and stood between the long white filaments. “Stop worrying—I dance between them, I tickle them—look! They love it!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">He tapped one of the white strands, then his shiny back reflected red as he ran to drink the nectar at the petals’ join. He buzzed in pleasure at the taste, and stood up, his face sticky and wet.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Delicious. No danger, so long as you don’t touch two.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Danger behind you!” the spider screeched. “Quickly!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The young bluebottle jumped back in alarm, knocking against another long white sword. The second touch triggered the trap. Flora just glimpsed his shocked face as the white-fringed petals bit together. He screamed and buzzed frantically, his hands clawing wildly through the gaps as the sound of fluid rose up inside the bloated bud.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Fooled him!” The spider shook with laughter, as the fly’s screams turned to gurgles, then silence. “Serves that greedy flower right too. It was really after <span class="italic">you</span>, but I will take that prize.” The spider held out her claws, checking their edges.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora clung to the wall and forced herself to look away. The smell of the fly’s liquefying body seeped from the green flower’s swollen lips and filled the air. Unable to locate the open window by scent, Flora searched the great plane of shining glass for a visual clue. All she could see was the conservatory reflected back at her. High on the wall above, something black moved.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora sprang from the wall into the air, buzzing and whirring her wings in panic. The spider crawled from her web and hung upside down from its thick elastic.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Treacherous little egg layer—challenging the Queen, if you please! But I suppose it must be time. . . . How old is she now? Three winters, four? I forget. But the fuss to change her—dear me!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Holy Mother is immortal—no one <span class="italic">changes</span> her.” Flora’s voice was strained, and the spider tutted.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Calm, my dear—terror ruins the taste. I only mean to help, by saving you from more blood on your hands.” Very slowly, the spider began creeping down the wall, closer to Flora. “If you go home you will cause madness . . . and turn sister against sister . . .” Her voice crawled low and insidious. “You will bring disaster to your hive . . . with unimaginable horrors.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“You lie!”</span> Before she knew it Flora was whirling in the narrow space of the conservatory, churning the terrible smell of the green flowers into the air. Unable to see or think, she crashed into the bright glass again and again. As she reeled dizzily in the air, the spider dropped heavily to the floor and ran about beneath her, waiting for her to fall.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora caught hold of a nail sticking out of the wall and clung there.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Good!” the spider called. “Wait there! I come to take you to a cradle of silk.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Shut up, you ugly sodden bag. You have no silk.” The huge wingless fly crawled along the window ledge and called across to Flora. “Bee! You spoke fairly to one of mine. Come to me now and I will show you the way out.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“How dare you? She is mine!” The huge spider ran about on the tiles in rage. Flora stared down, paralyzed.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Trust me,” the old bluebottle shouted at her, “if you would save yourself!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora tore her eyes away from the monster, then whirred her wings. Still stunned from all the collisions, she struggled to land on the windowsill near the fly. On the ground below, the spider searched for a place to start climbing toward them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Here, you must go past me.” The fly steadied Flora and pushed her forward to a thin vertical strut of metal running up the glass. “Lick your feet before you climb,” he said, “or you will fall—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora could smell the cold air coming from a gap in the glass above, and the oily stench of the spider rising from below. Then two huge hairy black legs crept up over the white windowsill and clutched for a hold—then two more. The spider reared up behind them, hissing in excitement.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora lashed her tongue across her dirty feet and scrambled up the slippery metal until she could claw herself onto the flat base of the tiny open window. The cold, free air stirred her wings and she looked down to thank the fly.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Buzzing defiance, he stood his ground before the great black spider that towered above him.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Go!” he yelled.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">F<span class="smallCaps">LORA TUMBLED IN THE FREEZING COLD</span> until her engine roared to life. The sky was almost dark as she hurled herself back across the gardens, searching for any familiar scent. She flew by instinct and the few remaining landmarks she could detect—the diesel trail of the road, the bitter tang of warehouse drains—and then to her joy and relief, she smelled the thin bright marker beacons. She hurled herself toward them, through the black tracery of the orchard branches, down to the dark, solid hive and the scents of her forager sisters.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora touched down on the landing board and ran into her beloved home with her quarter crop of nectar, and her life, and her burden of secrets.</p>
