<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">T</span><span class="smallCaps">HE SUMMER WAS ENDING, BUT NO EGG CAME</span>. D<span class="smallCaps">AY BY</span> day Flora scanned her body for a signal of another egg, but nothing changed except the shortening days and the growing hunger of the bees. Rather than return home empty, many dispirited foragers chose to give their tired bodies to the spiders in the hope the hive would profit. Then a priestess would fly out to the shroud and speak with the spider for a long time.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The first time she witnessed this strange conversation, Flora watched in dread from the landing board. When the priestess looked back at the hive and nodded, Flora’s antennae searched for the approach of the police, convinced the spider had revealed her secret. But the priestess landed back on the board with a somber face and almost ran to get back into the hive. The Thistle guards and all the bees on the board looked at each other at this discomposure—but none dared speak of it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The orchard shrouds became a terrible, and then a normal, fact of life. The diminishing band of foragers grew used to avoiding the webs but each night many died of exhaustion, and each day fewer returned than set out on their missions, for the smallest miscalculation of route could be fatal if their fuel was low.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora kept going, managing to gather what little there was. She discovered golden ragwort growing on the mounds of rubble behind the industrial complex, and though the bread its pollen made was coarse and tough, it provided a day’s food for the hive. Wasps also frequented this area, leaving smeary scent-trails in the air. Refusing to let her fear prevent her forage, Flora took to revving her engine drone-deep and battle-loud as she approached, daring any creature to stop her. The wasps watched her from a distance.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Proud cousin Apis,” one called out, and her voice was as drunken and slurred as her wingbeats. “We owe your hive a visit. After winter, when we have slept . . .” She reeled away in the air without finishing her words, her sisters with her.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">I<span class="smallCaps">N THE</span> D<span class="smallCaps">ANCE</span> H<span class="smallCaps">ALL</span> Flora relayed what the wasp had said. Her sisters buzzed uneasily, for everyone knew that wasps were full of threats, but none had ever heard of them sleeping. The casual quality of “after winter” was also disturbing, as if the wasps had no anxiety at all about their survival—whereas the dwindling rations in the canteens made all the orchard bees food-obsessed, and many were secretly convinced there was not enough to go around.</p>
<p class="x1BM">All the bees in the Dance Hall began talking and speculating, their voices growing louder and louder—and then every sister halted, her mind transfixed by a strange new signal in the comb.</p>
<p class="x1BM">It was a vibration, almost imperceptible, yet it carried a pheromone more powerful than the strongest Thistle’s war gland. It was definitely not Devotion, but it demanded their complete attention. As the sisters set their feet to read it more clearly, disturbing waves of energy pulsed into their bodies. The sensation was the opposite of the blissful reassurance of the Queen’s Love; they felt apprehensive and pent-up, as if they were about to defend their hive—and yet there was no call to arms. Antennae poised and ready, the bees waited.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Sisters!</span> The voice of the Hive Mind was low and intimate. <span class="italic">To celebrate the new Age of Austerity, we shall perform the Great Obeisance to the Males. Go each of you and find them all. Allow no delays, but bring them to the Dance Hall.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">The sisters ran to obey. Many of the drones were in their hall across the lobby, but it was with much grumbling and resistance that they were roused to go the short distance, for the smaller rations had provoked their gluttony, and staff shortages their laziness. Gradually they were cajoled out with pleading and flattery, and Flora felt a jab of irritation at their musty smell. Many of them had stale food in their fur, and one, Sir Poplar, refused to go another step without being groomed. The comb pulsed harder underfoot.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">By any means. Bring every drone to the Dance Hall.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">“Bloody Queen needs to know,” Sir Poplar muttered as they coaxed him into the Dance Hall. “Always her fault, when it comes down to it.” The sisters looked at him in shock.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“A great welcome to Your Malenesses,” spoke the beautiful wall of Sage priestesses, their wings unlatched and shimmering to heighten their kin-scent.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Bah,” said Sir Poplar loudly. He looked around the crowded chamber and wiggled himself closer to Flora. “So this is where you old girls rattle and shake, is it?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">She drew away from him, disturbed by the new vibration in the comb and the alien smell of so many drones in the feminine preserve of the Dance Hall.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We have performed our Treasury audit.” Sister Sage came forward. “Before we make the Great Obeisance to the Males, we shall read out the roll of honor. Sir Quercus: gone to glory!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">All the sisters applauded fervently, the drones less so.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sir Whitebeam: gone to glory.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The sisters applauded again, but slower.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sir Alder?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Here.” His voice came from deep in the crowd of sisters.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sir Chequer—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Here.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">As Sister Sage went on, the roll call of answering drones sounded increasingly sulky.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sir Poplar?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">He yawned loudly.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“What? Oh . . . Here . . .”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sir Linden?” Sister Sage waited. “Missing in passion. Honor to him.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Honor to him,” responded the sisters.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Clever little git, good riddance.” Sir Poplar pressed closer to Flora. “Very touching though, how you sisters get these crushes. Even when you know nothing can ever happen.” He fumbled intimately with her wing joint. “The way you followed him around, even to Congreg—” He gasped in pain as Flora squeezed her wing-latch shut and trapped his hand. “Holy Mother, where’s your sense of humor?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Attention.” Sister Sage commanded the chamber. The new vibration came more strongly through the comb and Flora let Sir Poplar retrieve his hand. He glared.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“All our brother drones are now accounted. Every sister kneel, then rise for the Great Obeisance to the Males.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Yes.” Sir Poplar shoved Flora down. “Back in your place.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">As the sisters all knelt to the drones, the vibration surged deep into their bodies.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Now lay your antennae at their feet,” continued the choral voice of the Sage. As every sister obeyed, the vibration went straight into their brains.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Hah!” Sir Poplar’s voice was small and distant and the sound made Flora want to sting him.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“All rise.” The Sage priestesses came forward to stand in a line of beauty and power. They touched their wings together.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Beloved daughters of One Mother,” Sister Sage addressed them. “Sisters of the hive, the turning season draws our prayer—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I’ve had it with that canting old hag.” Sir Poplar tried to get past Flora.</p>
<p class="x1BM">She broadened her thorax to block him. Anger curled inside her and she felt the urge to hit him. “You will stay.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Surely you are mad.” He shook his head. “You need the Kindness—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We will now observe the ancient ritual,” continued Sister Sage, “given by our Mother in the Time before Time. In the Great Obeisance to the Males, every sister shall play her part in the dance, and her body will know the steps. <span class="italic">Accept, Obey, and Serve.”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Accept, Obey, and Serve,”</span> the sisters repeated, their voices low and strange.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Enough of this drivel; out of my way.” Sir Poplar tried to shove past Flora, but his path was blocked by a close ring of sisters. “Are you all mad? Move!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The vibration amplified into a low hum, coming from every sister. As Sir Poplar looked at their faces, his own changed. “Obey at once, before I report you all.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Report us . . .” More than one of the sisters said it, and some of them began to croon it, dancing seductively in front of him. “Report us . . . Your Maleness . . .”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Stop that!” Sir Poplar’s voice was high and strained, and all around the Dance Hall other drones were similarly protesting.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The sisters’ hum grew louder.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“We praise Your Malenesses.”</span> Sister Sage began the oblation, and each of the circles of sisters began moving around its drone in formal steps, pushing him back to the center when he tried to break free.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">We give thanks for your power and grace.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">And your glory on the wing—</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">The dancing sisters changed direction, singing louder over his protests.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">We have lived to serve you.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Your time has come, your time has come.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Led by the choir of the Sage priestesses, the sister bees sang in overlapping rounds, their dancing circles changing direction, then flowing in crisscrossing lines moving through the Dance Hall, imprisoning the bewildered drones between them.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">We give thanks for your bodies and your lives,</span> sang the Sage choir, and the sisters danced faster, their words overlapping above the protests of the drones.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Your lusts and sloth,</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">And your idleness we now repay.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Louder and louder they sang to each drone as they passed him, and in flagrant contradiction of all etiquette, each sister defiantly let her kin-scent rise in his face.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">We now repay—</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">The drones scrabbled around trying to break through the singing, chanting chains of sisters, panicking at the new smell rising up through the comb. As the driving rhythm of the dance carried their bodies forward, all the sisters inhaled the thrilling scent of their own long-held anger, now released into their brains.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Our labor, our hive.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">The sisters danced around the drones, faster and faster in a great swirling pattern. Some hummed with a high, strange note; others let out little yelps of excitement.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Forgive us, Your Malenesses.</span> Sister Sage’s voice led them.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Before we cast you out!</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Many drones shouted it back at them, fear in their voices.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Cast us out?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“How dare you speak to Our Malenesses in that way—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Right, you filthy servant, move!” Sir Poplar shoved Flora hard. She did not flinch. He stared at her in astonishment. “Did you hear me?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Yes,” she said. With one blow she struck him off his feet. He looked up at her, stunned.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“She hit me!” he yelled as he struggled to rise. “Someone tell Holy Mother—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Why don’t you?” A meek little Cornflower kicked his feet out again. “Tell her how you blame her for everything! Isn’t that what you said?” At this, all the sisters began kicking and biting at the drones.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You should have found your princess, shouldn’t you?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Then you would not be here—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“All your bragging of sex and love—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“There, I have it, brothers!” yelled Sir Hornbeam. “They are mad with jealousy! We must flood them with our scent to make them docile!” He pumped his glands so that his male pheromone poured into the air. Others did the same and some tried to start their engines to fan it harder.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sisters made strange cries as they breathed it in and dropped their heads low, swinging them from side to side to breathe it more deeply. Others shrieked as they smelled it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Yes!” cried Sir Sycamore. “They need our dronewood, they crave it for themselves—” He grabbed a sister from Woodbine and held her close as if to mount her. “Shall I make you a princess, Sister?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">She screamed in rage as she twisted from his grip. “He mocks our virgin state!” She sliced at his face with her claws and he leaped back as she lunged at him—and then a command in the comb held every sister still.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Like every other sister in the packed Dance Hall, Flora paused and felt the tremors running up and down her antennae. She loved the feeling of venom swelling her sac, and her sting flexed strong and supple within her, longing to slide forth. Every sister in the hall slowly raised her claws, waiting for the signal in the comb.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The drones sought each other’s eyes and nodded in common purpose. They widened their thoraxes and raised their fur. Sir Poplar gave the signal.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Now!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">As the drones ran roaring at the sisters to barge past and escape, the comb fired its own chemical trigger. Shrieking and whirling, the sisters joined themselves together in chains of dancers three strong and corralled all the males into a circle. Some threw back their heads and splayed their antennae, while others dipped theirs and swung them from side to side with guttural sounds.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Isolated in their spinning rings of sisters, still shouting in protest, the drones could not hide the scent of their fear. The smell made Flora’s abdomen contract hard with pleasure, and at the thrill of her sisters’ flaring war glands she screamed with excitement.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Blessings on our brothers,</span> called out the choir of Sage as the bees danced.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Blessings on their flesh—</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sisters!” shouted a drone into the dense, swirling motion of the dance. “We beg you, cease your madness!”</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Blessings on Their Malenesses,</span> cried the Sage priestess.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">At the moment of their death—</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">The priestess fell upon the nearest drone with her jaws, and before he could scream his kin-scent burst bright and fatal on the heated air. The Dance Hall erupted into a frenzy of motion as the drones fought to escape and the sisters dragged them back.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sir Poplar roared and started his engine as his body was lifted up in the air by teeming sisters, but they broke his wings from his back and threw him down.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You insult Holy Mother—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Squander our food—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Pretend you would mate us as if we were queens—how dare you!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">It was the sister from Woodbine whom he had so insulted. She stood where he could see her face. <span class="italic">“Only the Queen may breed!”</span> She ripped his abdomen open down to his genitals, then tore out his penis and ate it. Sisters screamed in excitement as his blood splashed on their faces.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Only the Queen may breed!”</span> Flora screamed it again and again with all her strength, as if to purge herself of her guilt and shame, and as the drones screamed and tried to fly above the crazed females she too leaped to catch them and drag them back down into the savage mass.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Drones screamed as they were ripped apart or bitten to death, and the sisters’ feet slid on the bloodied, pulsing comb. Filled with consecrated anger at every insult and humiliation, every wasted forage and sullied passageway, they avenged themselves on the wastrel favorites, the sacred sons who did nothing for their keep but brag and eat and show their sex to those who must only labor for them and never be loved.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora and her sisters dragged one drone after another out into the corridor, and all throughout the hive was screaming and pleading and the high thick smell of blood as every single sister took active part and every drone fled for his life toward the landing board. Males who fell were dragged struggling out into the dazing sun, and there they were dispatched, down into the grass where the Myriad crawled to eat them alive, or tossed out upon the air they once ruled, flying toward death on torn and bloody wings.</p>
