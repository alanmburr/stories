<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">H</span><span class="smallCaps">ER BODY TENSE FROM THWARTED FLIGHT</span>, F<span class="smallCaps">LORA WENT</span> back into the hive. Pausing in the crowded corridor to relatch her wings, she heard weak, raised voices of the Poppy and other sisters coming from an antechamber near the morgue. Before she could hear what they said, the Thistle guards hurried everyone back inside, pushing them toward the Dance Hall.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Jittery bursts of buzzing came from the large assembly of bees. The pulses in the comb had called them there but it was not time for Devotion, nor, despite the definite trace of fear drifting in from the landing board, was there any smell of wasp. There was, however, an unpleasant odor somewhere close, and Flora instinctively drew away. The whole crowd rippled and flexed as one, and when the movement stopped, certain bees stood isolated in pools of space. Each was a forager, standing with her head down and her sides heaving for breath, and each showed the same gray film on her body as had the Poppy who crashed to the landing board.</p>
<p class="x1BM">A Sage priestess rustled her long, elegant wings for attention. Her antennae scanned the large hall.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sisters in One Mother, we give thanks for the sacrifices and valor of our noble foragers, <span class="italic">Amen.</span>”</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Amen,”</span> murmured the bees, currents of alarm passing between them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Behold our sister foragers, whose work is honor and whose precision, zeal, and stamina give life, health, and wealth to our hive. But whose mistakes and hubris bring disease, disgrace, and death. Many sisters have fallen sick and died today, and now we are certain of the cause.” Sister Sage pointed and two Thistle guards brought forward an old forager. Those bees nearest gasped in shock.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Madam Lily 500,” intoned Sister Sage. “What do you wish to say to your sisters and to Holy Mother, whose life you have brought into danger with your error?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Lily 500 raised her head. Her voice was hoarse but calm.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I do not make errors. The field was clean when I was there.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“No. It was poisoned. <span class="italic">And in your error</span> you sent countless sisters to their deaths. See the wounded now, the venomous mist burning holes in their bodies? And we have found tainted pollen in the stores, no doubt also gathered in error after your directions. Your prestige has made you careless—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I danced the truth!” Lily 500 raised her voice. “If the pollen was tainted I would not gather it. If the field was poisoned I would die rather than return—I swear on every royal egg—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“And now blasphemy!” called out Sister Sage. “Blasphemy, pride, and error.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“—and I swear on my love for the Queen that when I went to the flowers the mist was not there, nor have I ever gathered unclean pollen!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage spoke quietly. “Brave sisters who suffer, come forward.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Those isolated bees whose bodies were covered in the tiny gray specks and bore the strange scent walked or were guided forward to the center to join Lily 500. Some of them still scraped away at their bodies, trying to remove the gray film. Lily 500 stared at them, then bowed her head.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Forgive me, my sisters. I should rather have died than brought this home.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">No one spoke. Then a squad of identical bees parted the crowd, their fur slicked dark and their kin-scent veiled under a thick masking odor. They stood by Sister Sage.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Madam Forager, Lily 500, you have endangered our hive by your error. For the protection of Her Majesty the Queen, source of life and Immortal Mother, we must cleanse our hive of sickness.” Sister Sage looked around the silent hall. “If any sister ails, let her prove her love for Holy Mother and come forward.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">No one moved. In the silence Flora ran her consciousness around her body. On the landing board she had forgotten everything in her excitement at flight—but now she could feel the strange sensation in her belly again. It had more pressure, and as she focused on it, strange prickles of excitement ran through her. It was no longer pain, nor did she feel sick in any way. She decided not to speak of it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage looked at Lily 500.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We will remember the wealth you brought. Praise end your days.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Before the old forager could respond, the police dragged her away. At this humiliation of one of their greatest, all the sisters stared in shock.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage’s face shone bright, and tremors flew up her antennae as if she were at Devotion. “The Kindness is only for the diligent. Those whose carelessness endangers the hive may not receive it. We fearlessly protect Holy Mother, for we know <span class="italic">From Death comes Life Eternal.”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“From Death comes Life Eternal,”</span> responded all the bees. Then in one shared impulse, every affected forager unlatched her wings and stepped forward. Together they faced the police.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Death flies close on every mission,” said one, her body speckled with the gray film. “We need no escort now.” The foragers bowed to their sisters. <span class="italic">“Accept, Obey, and Serve.”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Praise end your days,”</span> said all the bees. The foragers walked out, the police guard behind them. The bees waited in silence, the comb underfoot completely still. They heard the weak engines of their sisters start up on the landing board and the power surge as they leaped into the air. Every bee in the Dance Hall strained to hear their engines fading as the sick foragers flew far from the hive, never to return.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Back to work,” Sister Sage announced. “Prepare for health inspection.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE ATRIUM EMPTIED</span> at great speed. Sisters rushed to get away from the police, and Flora attached herself to a large detail of sanitation workers. They were going to the morgue, where the day’s dead bodies must be removed, and their supervising sister was another Bindweed.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Because of poisoned pollen you will drop the bodies far beyond the orchard,” she told them, “and you will not return.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The workers looked at each other in alarm, but Sister Bindweed smiled.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“It is to the honor of your kin! You are so numerous that we can easily spare a few to ensure good hygiene. It is your privilege: <span class="italic">Accept, Obey, and Serve!</span>”</p>
<p class="x1BM">As the sanitation workers mumbled their incoherent response, Flora heard a cry of pain. She smelled Lily 500 close by, mixed with the harsh scent of the police.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Let me die with honor,” came the forager’s hoarse old voice. “Let me go with my sisters. . . . I promise I will not return—” She cried out as if she had received a blow. The sound came from the waste depot near the morgue.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I beg you,” came Lily 500’s agonized voice again, “at least kill me before you throw me to the Myriad—oh my sisters have forsaken me! Where are they?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora left her sisters going into the morgue and ran to find Lily.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE OLD FORAGER’S</span> <span class="smallCaps">LEGS</span> dragged on the wax tiles behind her and her wings were broken at both latches. Carrying her by the thorax, one on each side, the police turned down the approach to the landing board. Even outside in the bright air their powerful scent hurt Flora’s antennae as she ran toward them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Please,” she said, “may I attend my sister?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Lily 500 is sentenced to death. Do you seek to share her end?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“No, Officer, only to pray with her. I heard her call.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora dropped to her knees. The officers’ feet had huge black hooks and smelled of different kin, hideously mixed.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“The forager is unclean.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Yes, Officer, but I carry every kind of waste and do not fear disease. <span class="italic">Accept, Obey, and Serve</span>.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The police were silent, though their antennae radiated together. They stood back.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Quickly,” said one. “She is sentenced to die in exile.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora went to Lily’s side. Every joint of the old forager’s body was broken.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“To stop me returning,” whispered Lily. “As if I wished to live, after my mistake.” She gazed at her. “I know you . . .”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I saw you dance. You were so strong and beautiful and I wanted to follow, but . . .” Flora could not finish. Twelve black hooked feet walked closer.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Please, officers, we must pray—” Lily 500 pressed her antennae tight against Flora’s. “Open!” she whispered. “Do not waste it—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">A huge rushing sensation poured down Flora’s antennae and a torrent of sound and scent and image filled her brain. She did not feel the kicks that separated them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">When Flora could see again, Lily was gone and only one police bee stood on the board with her, looking up into the blinding blue. High beyond the orchard, a tiny black speck separated into two. One fell toward the earth, and the other turned and headed back to the hive.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora got to her feet, flashes of flowers and petals and fragrance filling her senses. The sky was wide open. But before she could unlatch her wings, the second police bee had landed beside her.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Number and kin.” Her voice was ugly and abrasive and Flora could see Lily’s blood still wet on her jaws. If she flew now they would knock her out of the air. She bowed her antennae subserviently.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Flora 717. Sanitation.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Then get there.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora ran back into the hive, Lily’s voice and chemical memories still flashing in her mind long after she had rejoined her kin.</p>
