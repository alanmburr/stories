<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">A</span><span class="smallCaps">S THEY DESCENDED OVER THE TREETOPS</span> F<span class="smallCaps">LORA</span> strained for any trace of scent of drones in case Congregation was near, but all she could pick up was a fragmented smell of an alien nectar. They flew low over the great gray road, its bitter stench soaking up into the air, and then across a small field of rye. That brash, familiar scent pushed into Flora’s brain and her senses began to revive. Vast gray-green fields swayed into the distance, but no fragrance of nectar or pollen drifted from ahead, only the dreary, useless odor of fibrous crops and strange tang of the earth beneath them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wasp hovered on lissome wings and watched Flora.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“So, that way lies your orchard, cousin—and as you see, it is a route to give you empty baskets.” She sighed. “To think of all you poor cousins, your flowers rotted in the rain and no clue what to do.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“There will be more flowers.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Not in our lifetime—do you not see the berries swell? All religions can read that sign. Many times we say at home, how we would willingly share our bounty with our cousins, for we have so <span class="italic">much</span>—how sad the Chosen People are too proud. Yet we Vespa long to forget the ancient feud.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You have pollen and honey?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wasp burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Cousin, you work too hard! We have <span class="italic">sugar,</span> like hard dewdrops of nectar, but soft as larvae inside. Sweeter than honey, stronger than that scabbing tree blood you gather.” She spat in disgust.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Propolis. It has many uses.” Flora tried not to be angry at her, for much might be gained from this friendship. She imagined herself on the landing board, unloading exotic treasure for her hive, insisting on the truth of its provenance.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Whatever you like to call it, cousin. But you might feed your whole hive with just a few mouthfuls of what we have. Never mind—here I must leave you. Good foraging, cousin.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Wait—” Flora flew after her. “You <span class="italic">truly</span> would share with us?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wasp dipped her wings demurely, and smiled.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">F<span class="smallCaps">LORA EXPECTED THEY WOULD HEAD</span> for the maelstrom of scents coming from the town, but instead the wasp led her to a cluster of gray warehouses on its edge. Brown-belching vehicles labored to and fro, and Flora noted them to add to her homecoming choreography. There would be so much to dance about, and such a fervor of excitement. To think that the ancient feud with the Vespa might be ended—that would be expiation indeed.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wasp checked over her wings that Flora was still behind her, and then began her descent toward the warehouse buildings. Flora logged as much information as she could, though her antennae were still slow and sore. She had never seen a place with so few plants, their stunted flower heads barely strong enough to open. Sensing the presence of a honeybee, they mustered their energy and breathed a poor wisp of scent to her.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Leave them,” said the wasp. “They’re pathetic.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">But where one plant stretched and pushed out its scent, so did all its neighbors, and supplications and pleas came from every flower in every crack of concrete or cinder-block wall for Flora to come to them. They called and begged her; they wanted to speak with her and feel her feet on their petals.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Very quickly.” Flora dropped down onto the soot-stained head of a buddleia trembling for her touch. It sighed in gratitude as Flora secured her hold, then pushed her tongue deep into a floret. A dirty film of oil coated its petals and she released it in disgust, rearing into the air. The buddleia drooped in shame.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Told you!” sang the wasp. “Come now, if you wish to feed your family. Or go home empty.” She flew into the dark, cavernous mouth of a warehouse.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora hovered outside. She was glad there was no one from her hive to have seen her try the weeds—for despite their nectar and warm welcome, surely that was what they were: low, coarse, desperate weeds. There had to be a good reason their forage was shunned—but she could not think of one. The words of the Catechism came back to her. <span class="italic">“Nor may a flora ever forage, for she has no taste.”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">The weeds had made a fool of her, and Flora was angry at herself for succumbing to their pleas. She whirred her wings louder to muffle their voices. The bees certainly did not know everything—if they did, they would not have lain dead at the foot of the murmuring tree in such numbers while the wasp went free. Ignoring the cries of the weeds, Flora flew into the warehouse.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The cavern was dim and vast, with a sharp, peculiar scent that hit Flora’s antennae as soon as she flew in, making them twitch in excitement and revulsion at the same time.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Here,” called the wasp, her voice deeper in the gloom. “This way, cousin.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora flew toward her under the crackling bars of fluorescent light that hung at intervals down the dark, curved ceiling. The walls were made of stacked containers, and below her on the concrete ground, slow, ungainly vehicles labored to move them to and fro. They reminded Flora of sanitation workers rolling balls of drone wax, and she noted this little detail to further enhance her homecoming choreography.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Come.” The wasp had returned to find her. Under the flickering lights Flora saw how young she was, her pointed black-and-yellow face completely smooth. A smile shone from her glossed black eyes, flatter than a bee’s and with elegantly glittered edges. She pivoted in the air and a wisp of formic acid drifted from her. She whirred it away with a sudden thrum of her wings.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Forgive my excitement,” she whispered to Flora. “Come and taste the sugar.” She flew to the wall and alighted on an irregularly shaped ledge, a glowing mosaic of rock in colors more lurid and vulgar than any petal could attempt. Flora’s antennae lashed in repulsion at the blaring scent, but her tongue stretched out to taste it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Fill your crop, cousin,” said the wasp. “Feel your hunger.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE SUGAR WAS SOLID</span> like propolis, soft like wax, then it melted like nectar. It was the most extraordinary substance, and the more Flora ate the more she wanted and the faster she chewed. As the taste raced through her brain, Flora abandoned decorum and gnawed at it as if she were breaking out of her emergence chamber. Each of the colors tasted slightly different, underlaid with a tang that almost made her want to retch, yet sharpened her appetite for more. She wanted to ask about it and where she might find this substance for herself, but she could not stop eating.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Far below on the ground, the vehicles whined and groaned and their engines hummed like sisters on the wing.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You like it, cousin?” The wasp chewed sugar nearby and watched Flora eating. She was generous, Flora thought, and she wanted to say so, but something in the colored nectar-rock kept her gnawing faster and faster.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Eat more,” the wasp said, a strange smile on her face. “Eat your fill.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Suddenly self-conscious of her greed, Flora slowed down as she prized the last blue crystal out. There was a strange vibration at her feet as it came free, and Flora looked down and noticed what she stood on.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Extending on either side of the gaily colored ledge of sugar beneath her was a chewed gray mix of paper and clay. It curved out in an irregular shape and finished some distance underneath, tight against the wall. It was a great wasps’ nest, and the roof was made of sugar. The vibration she had heard did not come from the vehicles on the ground, but from inside the nest. It was the high-pitched whining of thousands and thousands of wasp larvae under her feet.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora did not move. Now she felt the presence of all the wasps hovering close by in the air behind her, their scent masked by the thick smell of sugar she had raised by her frantic chewing, and their sound by the machines on the ground. In the time it took Flora to realize, the sugar under her feet hardened like propolis and held her fast.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The wasp watched her. Flora did not turn. Instead, she bowed her antennae.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Thank you for this feast, cousin,” she said, as calmly as she could. “You are so beautiful, with your tiny waist and sharp, smooth stripes. Will you spin so I can admire you?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The young wasp could not resist. She pirouetted on the air.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Please,” Flora said humbly, and curtsied low, “that was so rare a sight, I have only seen it done faster once before.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Faster?” the wasp retorted. “That was nothing; watch this.” And she spun again. Deep in her curtsy, Flora saw the massed horde of wasps hanging in the dim air of the cavern behind her. Quickly she bit her feet free of the sugar.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Are we not superior?” called the wasp within her spinning. “Admit it!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You are!” Flora cried, pulling her feet free. “Faster!” Then, roaring her thoracic engine like a rampant drone, she shot backward as hard as she could into the ambush of wasps, scattering them in the air.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Apissss!”</span> they screamed, rearing up from their shock. <span class="italic">“Apisss, die!”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">They came at her from all sides, shrieking their fury and filling the air with the scent of their wet-drawn daggers. Flora plunged and swerved while inside the nest the larvae whined a thin, sick note of hatred through the paper walls, and their captives screamed for mercy in all the languages of the air.</p>
<p class="x1BM">At the obscene, intimate brush of wasp wings against her own Flora lost her axis and fell. She tumbled in a sickening mist of sugar and formic acid and righted herself just before she hit the ground.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The mouth of the cavern was bright and Flora threw herself toward it just as one of the great lumbering vehicles drew across it and blocked the entrance. In a desperate swerve she dived through the tiny aperture into the driver’s cab and the torrent of wasps poured in after her.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The driver yelled in fright and thrashed his hairy forearm around his head, knocking Flora to the ground and maddening the wasps. As they stung him from all sides, Flora crawled into a groove of dirt and hid. The driver screamed and pressed on the horn so that the vehicle itself bellowed like a wounded bull, then he wrenched open the door and staggered out. At the touch of air on her wings Flora dragged herself over the metal step and fell to the concrete floor. While the wasps descended on the writhing man she crawled toward the light and air. The weeds pulsed their scent to help her, and she used it to pull herself forward until she felt the sky above.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE CLOUDS WERE VIOLET-GRAY</span> and the cold air trembled in bursts and stops. Fighting off the numbing fog of the formic acid, Flora struggled for altitude, her wing-joints burning. Below her she could still hear the enraged buzz of the wasps and the shouts of the men running to drive them from their screaming victim.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora climbed higher, trying to pick up the azimuth of the sun with her sugar-jangled antennae. She thought she had filled her crop with sugar, but it was light and empty.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Ashamed at her failure to forage and sick from the taste of the sugar, all that Flora now wanted was the scent of home. She turned again and again, but nothing registered. All she felt was the racing pulse of sugar.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora cursed her pride—she of all kin should have listened to the weeds. If she lived to see another sunrise she would kiss every one of their mouths. She flew in a circle, then in a figure eight, trying to pick up the scent of the orchard, of the great road, of Congregation, of anything familiar, but great waves of wind collided and she had to flatten her antennae and tighten her wings lest they be ripped from her body. A colossal cold swell threw her sideways and a warm front flung her back. With a tearing flash of light, the storm broke.</p>
<p class="x1BM">A water bomb hit Flora on her right side, and she felt her wing-latch breaking between the front and rear membranes. Clenching her thoracic muscles to hold her wing panels together, she aimed herself into the racing air current streaming toward the tree line. Pelting raindrops knocked her lower and lower, and with a great lurch of strength she flung herself into the nearest canopy of leaves. She tumbled down the dripping green slides trying to grab hold of anything, but her claws slipped and she fell to the earth.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Directly ahead under the drumming leaves was a place of shelter. To reach it she must crawl across a shining track left by some unknown creature, but if she did not move, the water bombs would take away all choice and she would lie drowning with broken wings. Nothing was in sight so Flora stepped quickly across it. She was almost at the dry sanctuary of twigs when a sound made her look around.</p>
<p class="x1BM">It did not look at her, for it had no eyes, but a great brown slug pulled its way back toward her along the silvery mucus trail, its orange frill rippling as it moved. It was nothing but a rhythmically convulsing sack of muscle, then it raised its gaping, drooling mouth, and made a sound between a grunt and a moan. Two flaccid horns engorged and lifted, and then its tiny eyes bulged out from their tips. It moaned again as its slime spread behind it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">A forager’s suicide in the rain was better than cowering on the ground waiting to be engulfed by the slug. Soaked and battered, Flora fought her way higher until a snarl of air caught her up and sucked her tiny body into the roaring mouth of the storm.</p>
