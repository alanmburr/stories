<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">A</span><span class="smallCaps">T THE SIGHT OF</span> S<span class="smallCaps">ISTER</span> S<span class="smallCaps">AGE, ALL THE</span> C<span class="smallCaps">ATEGORY</span> Two nurses and nannies curtsied, though they looked warily at Flora walking with her. The priestess was not angry that her Flow had stopped, and seemed only to want to talk.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I would have said the experiment was a success,” she said to Flora. “And I am sure Sister Teasel impressed on you the privilege of such sacred service.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Yes, Sister. I am very grateful.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“But you are very curious about Category Two—a rather prosaic place, to my mind. Why is that?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The more she breathed of Sister Sage’s strong scent, the more Flora grew calm, and felt an overpowering desire to tell the truth.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“In Category One everything is always the same.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage laughed. “The very point of Identical Care. Yet it bored you.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Yes, Sister. Forgive me.” Flora lowered her head, but Sister Sage raised it and held her long antennae over Flora’s.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We will forget the folly of the curtsies and your boldness in hoping to see Holy Mother, for I hear you are also very devout and hardworking.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I hope so, Sister.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“And you love the Queen?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“With my body and my soul.” Flora’s antennae trembled as she felt Sister Sage reaching deep into her mind.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Would you serve her any way you can?</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">“With my whole life.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Good.” Sister Sage walked on. “In this time of scarce forage, you have been surprisingly useful in the Nursery. Sometimes it is good to spare the deviants, and experiment a little.” She smiled. “Is this place as you imagined?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Better, Sister! It is so lively, so full of wonderful things—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Then look your fill. I wish you to know it.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">F<span class="smallCaps">LORA COULD NOT TAKE</span> in Category Two all at once, with its cheerful decorations and beautifully tiled play areas. Pretty nurses and nannies sat with their vigorous little charges, singing and playing games or feeding them from shining platters. Healthy, beautiful child-grubs were everywhere, their cheerful snubby little faces speckled with golden pollen dust. Gone were the heavy scent of Flow and the mumble of prayer, and in their place the bright aroma of fresh bread and the sounds of nursery rhymes and laughter.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage watched her. “What do you know of feeding patterns?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Nothing, Sister.” Flora admired two fat child-grubs who chuckled as their nurses tickled them. “Sister Teasel asked me that. All I know is that timing is very important, and there are a lot of bells.” Her own arms tingled to hold a baby, and she turned away lest the sin of Desire take hold. “And we must always stop at the right moment and never give a drop more.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Because . . . ?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I’m not sure, Sister.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage touched one of Flora’s antennae with her own, and Flora felt a piercing resonance in her mind. The sensation grew almost unbearable, then abruptly stopped as Sister Sage released her.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Good. You are truthful.” Her long antennae flexed. “Tell me, though, about my sisters Teasel: do they hold any meetings or gatherings in the Nursery?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I don’t think so.” Flora felt a strong urge to please the priestess with the right answer. “But I know only the one, my supervising sister.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Ah yes. To you they are all the same. And so they very nearly are, though they must still use speech to know each other’s thoughts. It is most quaint. But you will tell me if they hold private meetings, do you understand?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Yes, Sister.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">They had come to the end of the Category Two ward, where large carved panels marked another set of doors. Flora could not decipher the markings but knew instinctively not to touch them. Sister Sage answered her unspoken question.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“They speak of Holy Time, when we have all slept in prayer.” Her voice was soft and her face shone as if she experienced some great inner joy. “Each Devotion, we recall something of that state.” She remained rapt in contemplation.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora felt it correct to stand in silence beside her. A movement caught her eye. It was another of the wretched dark sanitation workers, moving along the ward gutter with her pan and brush and looking directly at Flora and the priestess. Flora pressed her knees together and drew herself up as thin and tall as she could, trying to emphasize the difference between them. Steadily sweeping, the worker passed on. Though nothing more than a look had been exchanged, Flora felt angry and agitated.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Do not blame yourself; no one may choose their kin—or all would be Sage.” No longer in her enraptured state, the priestess smiled. “Because your kin lacks botanical heritage, it forms the base of our society. Or rather, you draw your heritage from impure and promiscuous flowers, shunned by this hive.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sister Sage! Sister Sage!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Teasel’s strained voice reached down the long, wide corridor of Category Two. They smelled her streaming panic before they saw her running toward them with antennae waving and wild fear on her face.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Please—you must—both of you, I beg you—” Sister Teasel could hardly speak. “Everyone must report at once, the fertility police are here now on our ward!”</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">A<span class="smallCaps">S</span> F<span class="smallCaps">LORA FOLLOWED</span> Sister Sage back through the Category Two ward, every nurse and nanny clutched her little charge tightly to her and stared at them in silence. Up ahead through the big double doors, the Category One ward was no longer dim and hushed but starkly illuminated and pulsing with a harsh, bitter scent. Flora stumbled as her brain struggled to recall it. Sister Sage took her by the arm to quicken her pace and strengthened her own scent around both of them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You have nothing to fear.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">They went into the ward. At first Flora thought the nurses had left, because all the cribs were unattended and some of the babies were already starting to cry, but then she saw them all standing in lines near the ward sisters’ station. Some openly wept in fear, their antennae waving uncontrollably, while others held theirs high and rigid. Stationed around the edges of the ward were the fertility police. Their kin-scents were hidden under their masking scent, their eyes were blank, and their fur was slicked dark against their bands—but Flora recognized them from the Arrivals Hall. Sister Sage curled a filament of her own scent around Flora’s antennae and she felt her mouth clamp shut. The priestess joined her to the end of the first row, then stepped forward and bowed to the police.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sister Inspector, Sister Officers. Welcome.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Inspector saluted her, then turned to address the nurses.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Another wing deformity has been found.” The masking scent distorted her voice to a harsh buzz. Despite their fear, the nurses murmured in revulsion.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Praise to the vigilant Thistle guard on the landing board.” Her scent fired in jagged bursts as she surveyed the nurses.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Teasel began to weep. “Not <span class="italic">here,</span> Madam Inspector, never in Category One; it is not possible—Holy Mother is here every day, her scent so beautiful and strong—there can be no—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Silence!” the Inspector spat at her. “Do you think I mean the defect could come from <span class="italic">Her Majesty</span>? You fly close to treason yourself, Sister—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Holy Mother strike me dead before my next breath if so—” Sister Teasel fell to her knees, but Sister Inspector yanked her back on her feet.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Measure her.” She shoved Sister Teasel at two of her officers and they lashed their black calipers around her thick waist. Sister Teasel voided herself in fear and the smell mingled with the scent of the nurses’ terror, rising from their breathing spiracles. Behind them all the babies began to cry. Sister Sage looked on calmly.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Not her, at any rate.” The Inspector released Sister Teasel, then turned to the nurses. “Deformities mean evil roams our hive. Somewhere hides a desecrating heretic who dares steal sacred Motherhood from the Queen. That is why sickness comes, that is why deformities rise. From her foul issue!<span class="italic">”</span> Her antennae twitched compulsively and Flora felt her longing for violence.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Only the Queen may breed,” responded Sister Sage, looking at the nurses.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Only the Queen may breed,”</span> some of them managed to respond, but others stared at Sister Teasel, her antennae bent in shame as she desperately cleaned herself. The Inspector held up a long, sharp claw to the ward.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We will search every crib, we will measure every nurse’s belly until we find the culprit. And then we will tear her filthy body apart and cleanse our hive of sin.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Do what you must, Sister Inspector.” Sister Sage bowed again.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Inspector signaled and some of her officers began moving systematically through the rows of cribs, while others used the black calipers on their arms to measure the bellies of the terrified nurses.</p>
<p class="x1BM">When it was her turn, Flora looked in distress at Sister Sage, convinced her greedy appetite would mark her as doomed, but the priestess ignored her. The calipers went around her belly, but the police moved on, measuring each bee until all the nurses were cleared and none found guilty.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Those who dared turned to look at the cribs where the larva-babies wailed as officers swept each one up. With the powerful scanners of their antennae, they sent sharp vibrations through the small, tender bodies. The babies cried in fear and regurgitated their Flow, and the smell of it mixed with their infant defecation.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Our Mother, who art in labor—”</span> Sister Teasel’s voice was hoarse and small, but her nurses joined their own in support.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Hallowed be Thy womb,”</span> they sang to control their fear.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Thy Marriage done, Thy Queendom come—”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora wanted to join in, but the scent from Sister Sage had bound her rigid.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“From Death comes Life Eter—”</span> The beautiful voices stopped at the sharp squealing from one of the cribs.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Every nurse stared in horror as one of the officers bent over it. The squeal became an anguished shriek as the officer held up a larva-baby struggling to roll itself up. Another officer uncurled it with a sound of tearing skin.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Standing by Flora, Sister Inspector slid a claw from her gauntlet. “Bring it.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Muffling the baby’s screams, she scanned it with slow-burning antennae until its pearly skin withered. “It is possible,” she announced. “It has a foul, strange scent.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“That is fear!” cried Sister Teasel.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Ignoring her, Sister Inspector held up the baby and pierced it with her hook. It shrieked and twisted in agony as she held it out to her officers.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Destroy it.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Wait.” Sister Sage pointed to Flora. “Let her.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">With a jolt Flora felt herself released to move. Sister Inspector pulled her claw from the larva-baby to drop it on the ground, but Flora caught it and clutched it to her, the first child she had ever held. Its warm blood soaked into her fur and she pressed the agonized little thing close to her, trying to stanch the bleeding.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Eat it alive.</span> The voice spoke inside Flora’s own mind. She held the baby tighter and a searing sound went through her antennae.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Do it NOW. Tear it apart.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora bowed her own head over the baby and shielded it with her arms. The voice roared louder in her mind.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">DESTROY IT—</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Her antennae felt like they burst with the blow that struck her. She staggered and fell, the baby still clutched to her. Blows fell against her body, and her antennae became two pulsing rods of agony. The screaming baby was pulled from her grasp. She felt its warm blood splash her face and heard its tearing flesh and the grunts of the fertility police as they devoured it. As Flora screamed, her tongue twisted hard in her mouth and she choked on the sound.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I asked too much.” Sister Sage’s voice was close and gentle. “The experiment is over.”</p>
