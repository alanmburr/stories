<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">O</span><span class="smallCaps">N THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY, THE BEES SPRANG</span> from their beds and rushed to make all ready for the coming of the new Queen. Foragers ran to the landing board to check the weather and kept their spirits high despite the Thistle still blocking their exit, for the rain fell thick and cold. No Sage priestess appeared to announce the period of fasting over, nor did the Hive Mind speak, but the hungry bees milled around outside the canteens waiting for some signal, some smell of the upcoming feast.</p>
<p class="x1BM">There was none. By afternoon, every sister’s belly was clutching at itself, and even the most devout had no more energy for pacing in prayer. They were ready to welcome the new princess, they were ready to eat, and they were ready to cheer to the skies for the return of order and security.</p>
<p class="x1BM">It was almost evening before the Sage appeared, and they did so en masse in every lobby and canteen. Barely three days since the Queen was killed, and now they all wore mantles, the style of dress last favored by Her Majesty and her ladies. The Sage were decorated—the time had come at last! Whirring in joyous excitement, the sisters rushed to be close to their priestesses—but at their somber expressions, they fell silent.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Due to the inclement weather”—the Sage used their choral voice—“the arrival of the new Queen has been delayed. The period of fasting is over, but the Interregnum is extended.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The bees burst out with questions but the Sage held up their mantles.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“There will be no questions. <span class="italic">Accept, Obey, and Serve</span>.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">There was the briefest pause before the bees responded.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Accept, Obey, and Serve.”</span> They watched the priestesses go, a cordon of police around them.</p>
<p class="x1BM">As soon as they were out of sight, a ravenous hunger seized the bees. They ran into the canteens and pulled whatever rations they could from the stores. With some difficulty, they forced themselves to pass and share. Nobody wanted to be the first to speak. Flora ate what she could, but she knew it was not enough. She felt her cheeks. If the princess was late, then her egg would hatch and need feeding before the Nursery was fully operational again. Her baby would need Flow—and if there were no nurses, it would die.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Starvation.</span> Someone had said the word in the canteen, and the long-repressed fear burst in the air above all the bees. Before they knew it, every sister was asking about food or speculating on its lack or demanding to know from the foragers when the weather would lift and they could start working again, for the fasting had sharpened their appetite for Devotion—but the Queen did not come! <span class="italic">She did not come, and they had been promised!</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Their voices became a din, with some sisters shouting for silence, others for answers, and arguments broke out over a crust of pollen bread. Flora’s brain jammed with her panic for her child, and she felt a scream building in her own chest.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Sisters! Hear yourselves!” It was the booming voice of a Thistle guard. She stood up and banged her own plate down amid the squabbling bees. “Take mine! Would you be like the wasps?” Every other Thistle in the room put her own plate down for others, and the noble gesture silenced the bees.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We will wait,” said the first Thistle. “The Queen will come.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“The Queen will come,” repeated the bees. The words gave them strength. “The Queen will come!”</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">T<span class="smallCaps">HE NEXT MORNING,</span> there was again no sign of the Sage, but the skies had cleared and the air was warm once more. Bees gathered to applaud and shout Queenspeed to the foragers as they ran for the board, for the sisters longed for order and security. If they could not have it in the form of Devotion to and from a new Queen, then the next best thing was to refill the Treasury, and make the canteen tables groan with food.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The drones had no such patience. The new Queen was late, the weather was still cold and damp, and they did not care if the sisters ate little—they still wanted more. Working themselves up to a high hormonal display of temper and resentment, they joined together and marched up to the Treasury to protest to the Sage priestesses gathered there. Frightened and fascinated, sisters rushed after them to witness it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">When the Sage priestesses simply listened, the drones grew angrier.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“You hear our complaints, and do nothing?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage inclined her head politely.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We have more pressing matters.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The drones looked at each other in astonishment.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Than <span class="italic">our</span> comfort?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Brothers, if they think so little of us—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We shall find a better home!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">With that, and despite the wailing protests of the sisters, the drones stormed down to the landing board in a rage and took to the air.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Returning with a scant crop of viburnum nectar, Flora passed them in the air and felt their turbulence. Sisters wept on the landing board, crying for the males to come back, but Flora pushed past them to give her load to a waiting receiver. All she wanted to do was quickly pass on the directions in the Dance Hall, then find a way to get to her egg without being seen.</p>
<p class="x1BM">She ran into the atrium and stopped. Foragers stood waiting, but there was no atmosphere of joy or anticipation, and though many dutifully followed her steps, she knew it was without enthusiasm. Flora wanted to rouse them—but all her energy was focused on going to her child, and she left with a guilty heart.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Outside in the lobby she paused. Since she had danced it had become crowded with many sisters, but instead of passing through on their business, they stood talking in little clusters of kin groups. Most numerous were the Teasel. Some stood together, but others moved around the gathered sisters, murmuring earnestly.</p>
<p class="x1BM">No bees stood near the entrance to the prohibited corridor, for the propolis disinfectant smell was overpowering, but as the lobby kept filling up, more and more sisters gathered near it. Every defensive urge sparked within Flora—she wanted to run down the corridor and protect her vulnerable egg—but to go now was to invite discovery. She forced herself to remain where she was. The tiny second heartbeat within her own had grown stronger.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora’s cheeks prickled, then a faint sweetness filled her mouth. She swallowed quickly, her heart thudding. <span class="italic">Flow.</span> It could only be the sign that her egg was hatching—at any moment her baby would emerge, and cry for food.</p>
<p class="x1BM">She looked around in desperation. The only way she could reach her baby was to ask the noble kins of Violet and Speedwell to move aside—a breach of hive etiquette guaranteed to focus attention on her. If she could only see her own kin-sisters there, she could join them—but mindful of the general distaste for their presence, all the sanitation workers had withdrawn.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora swallowed down a mouthful of Flow. If she saw anyone going down toward her egg, she knew she would run and fight to protect it—but until then, the best thing she could do was pass unnoticed, and move when the crowd dispersed.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“The Queen will come,” intoned a Thistle from the center of a somber-faced group of her own kin. “The Queen will come,” her sisters repeated, but their tone lacked conviction.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“But not from the Sage!” A young Teasel shouted from the center of her own group. All the bees in the lobby turned to stare at this reckless sister with the brindled fur. “Because they are sick,” she continued, her eyes wild. “Why else have they not produced their princess?” She looked around the lobby. “If even Holy Mother could sicken, then why not her priestesses?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Before she could say another word a group of police burst the gathered Teasels apart and dragged her out. One of them cuffed her hard against the side of her head, another kicked her legs out from under her.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Blasphemy!” said one of the officers.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“The Kindness is too good—” said another, raising her hooked gauntlet.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The brindled Teasel tried to claw her way up through their bodies. “Sisters!” she screamed as the blows rained down. “This is what happens when you speak the truth—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The police closed in on her and the bees heard her shell cracking.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Stop at once!” The group of Thistle guards rushed to pull off the fertility police. “What is the meaning of this outrage, <span class="italic">Officer</span>?” The most senior Thistle guard used her claw to hold Sister Inspector between her head and her thorax. “This lobby is a place of gathering and talk—what laws do you enforce here?” She released Sister Inspector, who stared at her with hate.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“The Law of Treason!” She spat the word at the Thistle, and her officers held their claws ready, pointed at the group of Teasel. The young Teasel on the ground stood up, and all the bees could see she was wounded, but she turned to face her attackers again.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Without our Queen,” she said loudly, “how can there be treason?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The truth of this silenced every bee. Then Sister Inspector hissed in rage. “Treason against the Sage!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“The Sage are a kin like any other,” cried the young Teasel, her hand to her wounded thorax. “But they think they are all queens—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The bees gasped to hear this and Sister Inspector raised her claw. Before she could strike the Teasel again, the large Thistle guard stepped between them. “What dark days are these?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Indeed, when the kin of Thistle seeks to advance itself!” Sister Inspector’s voice was harsh and ugly. “But all the hive knows who killed the Queen.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Thistle guard bowed her head.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“To our eternal sorrow.” Then she looked at Sister Inspector and raised her own antennae thick and strong. “All sisters may gather here and speak freely. Remove yourselves.”</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Remove yourselves</span>. The thrilling words rippled through the bees like the Hive Mind, but the comb had not spoken—only one brave Thistle guard. The sisters gathered behind her, a silent show of strength.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Inspector looked murderous—then gathered her officers and left. The bees began to applaud, but the Thistle guard who had spoken so bravely rounded on all of them. She pointed to the group of Teasel.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“The Queen will come! And until then, do not provoke the police.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“No, Sister. Thank you.” Many Teasel bowed to the Thistle, but she was not looking anymore. Her antennae were turned to the corridor to the landing board. Flora smelled it at the same time.</p>
<p class="x1BM">A wasp approached.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Every bee in the lobby flexed her dagger and ran toward the landing board, the Thistle at the vanguard. Flora and other foragers squeezed themselves to the front and joined the line of Thistle guards scanning the orchard.</p>
<p class="x1BM">There, at the perimeter of the hive scent markers, one lone wasp cruised. She was long and gleaming, and her legs were bright yellow. At the sight of the bees on the board she came closer, and they saw the two white dots painted above each eye. She hovered above the hive—then with a flash of her stripes she was gone.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sisters cheered, and congratulated each other in high tense voices. Their show of strength had driven her off; how dare a wasp come prowling in the orchard? They had shown her; look, even the Teasels from the Nursery came to fight!</p>
<p class="x1BM">The foragers did not join in, nor the Thistle, still scanning the air. The wasp was of a kind none had seen before, and they did not like it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">More sisters came pouring down to the Dance Hall lobby, for news of the standoff between the Thistle and the police had spread through the hive, and they wanted to talk about the mad and reckless Teasel, and the way everyone had driven off the wasp. And in the mass of gossip and grooming and anxious talk, Flora slipped away.</p>
