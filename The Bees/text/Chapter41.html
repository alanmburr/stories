<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">T</span><span class="smallCaps">HE RETURN OF THE DRONES LIFTED THE HIVE’S SPIRITS</span> for one day, but the underlying tension between the Sage and the Teasel could not be repressed any longer. The colony became polarized, with both Sage and Teasel demanding that every kin group choose its loyalty. A priestess had gone missing—but so, shouted the Teasel loudly, had several of their senior sisters—and the lobbies filled with argument. Only the sanitation workers were ignored, for neither the Teasel nor the Sage cared about them except to make sure they cleaned properly. Flora remained with her kin-sisters despite the good foraging weather, for not only did she have a reason to visit the morgue, but she was extremely tired. For the first time in her life, she felt no desire to fly. It saddened her to see the scuffles between kin, and the deterioration of the hive’s condition. The beautiful central mosaics in the lobbies no longer glowed and pulsed with energy, and without the resonant frequency of the Hive Mind, the comb lost its beauty. The waiting made the bees both angry and despairing, for they had been intimidated into supporting one side or the other—but each one longed for Devotion, and heard her own mind whisper fearfully:</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">I will worship any Queen.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">B<span class="smallCaps">Y NIGHTFALL,</span> the bees were frantic. The dormitories were full of arguing, many bees complaining they could not—or did not want to—sleep in proximity to sisters loyal to Teasel, or loyal to Sage, and the air was rancid with discord. Some lay in their berths wailing for Devotion, while others berated them for reminding them of the precious thing they tried to forget.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We must be patient!” someone shouted near Flora.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We are damned,” spat someone else. “This hive is plagued—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Uproar broke out and both the Thistle guards and the fertility police stormed in, each demanding to know who had started it. The bees cowered in silence. The guards and the police gestured to each other with extravagant and dangerous courtesy, to allow the other to be the first to leave. The Thistle allowed themselves to be the first to go, and as the police followed, they looked back into the dark dormitory and sent a blast of their frightening scent across the bees loyal to Teasel.</p>
<p class="x1BM">No one dared speak. Gradually, the dormitory fell silent, except for those berths where some sister could not stop crying.</p>
<p class="x1BM">In the morning, many refused to rise.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Without a Queen,” said one, turning her face to the wall, “I have no will.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“No children born,” said another. “No life to work for.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora shook a sister. “But we have each other—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“We did.” A Rosebay forager rocked herself. “Until we maddened with fighting. To see such bitterness between us—I will die of heartbreak before a new Queen comes.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora held her.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Please, Sister, do not. If the house bees see the foragers stop flying—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Rosebay pushed her off.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“<span class="italic">You</span> have given up! You were one of our best—but now you cling in fear to your dustpan, too scared to fly. Your heart is broken too.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“It is not!” Flora stood up. “It is full of love, I swear it.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Then forage!” cried a Cornflower, her wings disheveled and dry.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“If my sisters ask me.” Flora unlatched her wings. “If they will fly beside me.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Rosebay forager sat up. She got to her feet. “I care for my sisters. Not for politics.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The Cornflower stood too. “And I for flowers. And our hive.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Our hive.” All over the dormitory, wing-latches clicked open as other foragers rose from their berths.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST">O<span class="smallCaps">N THE LANDING BOARD</span> the sun shone hot and hard, and waves of sweetness poured through the air. The foragers looked at each other in amazement. In their despairing queenless state, they had almost missed the start of the spring honeyflow. Now that they stood on the warming wooden ledge of the landing board, they felt the life-force pull the green blades up through the soft earth and swell the buds on the branches. Corms burst below the soil and high above it eddies of golden pollen carried on the wind.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The foragers laughed as they woke from their sorrow. The world was come to life again, and at the glorious sound of their engines starting, more sisters came running out onto the landing board. At first they too were dazed, for the grim power struggle within the hive had sapped them all of strength—but at the sight of their brave forager sisters rising up once more into a blazing blue sky, they began to cheer.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The tiredness in Flora’s body was a benediction of her skill, for even as she felt her joints stiffen and her engine straining, she used all her knowledge and experience to effortlessly guide her through the currents and track the finest scents. She delighted when she discovered the first narcissus in bloom, the flower every bee longed to find for its exquisite fragrance—the somewhat bland pollen being an afterthought. Its scent filled Flora’s soul with such flower joy so that she no longer felt any pain or weakness in her body—and then she foraged with all her skill and power. She found crocus and daffodil and then pale green hebe flowers, their startling pink pollen grains plump and moist like tiny berries. She filled her panniers, she filled her crop, and a thousand fluorescent petals and patterns returned to her mind. She was deep in the apple blossom with the Holy Chord all around her when she felt a jolt in her body.</p>
<p class="x1BM">That slow, steady frequency, hidden in her own pulse so long she had ceased to notice it, abruptly stopped. She whirled around as if the hive had called her.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Her daughter had woken.</p>
