<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">T</span><span class="smallCaps">HE CELL SQUEEZED HER, AND THE AIR WAS HOT AND</span> fetid. All the joints of her body burned from her frantic twisting against the walls. Her head was pressed into her chest and her legs shot with cramps, but her struggles had worked—one wall felt weaker. She kicked out with all her strength and felt something crack and break. She forced and tore and bit until there was a jagged hole into fresher air beyond.</p>
<p class="x1BM">She dragged her body through and fell out onto the floor of an alien world. Static roared through her brain, thunderous vibrations shook the ground, and a thousand scents dazed her mind. All she could do was breathe until gradually the vibration and static subsided and the scent evaporated into the air. Her rigid body unlocked and she calmed as knowledge filled her mind.</p>
<p class="x1BM">This was the Arrivals Hall, and she was a worker.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Her kin was flora and her number was 717.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Certain of her first task, she set about cleaning out her cell. In her violent struggle to hatch she had broken the whole front wall, unlike her neater neighbors. She looked, then followed their example, piling her debris neatly by the ruins. The activity cleared her senses, and she felt the vastness of the Arrivals Hall and how the vibrations in the air changed in different areas.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Row upon row of cells like hers stretched into the distance, and there the cells were quiet but resonant, as if the occupants still slept. Immediately around her was great activity, with many recently broken and cleared-out chambers and many more cracking and falling as new bees arrived. The differing scents of her neighbors also came into focus, some sweeter, some sharper, all of them pleasant to absorb.</p>
<p class="x1BM">With a hard, erratic pulse in the ground, a young female came running down the corridor between the cells, her face frantic.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Halt!”</span> Harsh voices reverberated from both ends of the corridor and a strong, astringent scent rose in the air. Every bee stopped moving except the young female, who stumbled and fell across Flora’s pile of debris. Then she clawed her way into the remains of the broken cell and huddled in the corner, her little hands up.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Cloaked in a bitter scent that hid their faces and made them identical, dark figures strode down the corridor toward Flora. Pushing her aside, they dragged out the weeping young bee. At the sight of their spiked gauntlets, a spasm of fear in Flora’s brain released more knowledge. They were police.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“You fled inspection.”</span> One of them pulled at the girl’s wings so another could examine the four still-wet membranes. The edge of one was shriveled.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Spare me,” she cried. “I will not fly; I will serve in any other way—”</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Deformity is evil. Deformity is not permitted.”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Before the young bee could speak the two officers pressed her head down until there was a sharp crack. She hung limp between them and they dropped her body in the corridor.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“You.”</span> Their peculiar rasping voice addressed Flora. She did not know which one spoke, so she stared at the black hooks on the backs of their legs. <span class="italic">“Hold still.”</span> Long black calipers slid from their gauntlets and they measured her height. <span class="italic">“Excessive variation. Abnormal.”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">“That will be all, officers.” At the kind voice and fragrant smell, the police released Flora. They bowed to a tall and well-groomed bee with a beautiful face.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Sister Sage. This one is obscenely ugly.”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“And excessively large—”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">“It would appear so. Thank you, officers, you may go.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage waited for them to leave. She smiled at Flora.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“To fear them is good. Be still while I read your kin—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I am Flora 717.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Sister Sage raised her antennae. “A sanitation worker who speaks. Most notable . . . ”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora stared at her tawny-and-gold face with its huge dark eyes. “Am I to be killed?”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Do not question a priestess.” Sister Sage ran her hands down the sides of Flora’s face. “Open your mouth.” She looked inside. “Perhaps.” Then she inclined her head over Flora’s mouth and fed her one golden drop of honey.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The effect was immediate and astonishing. Clarity washed Flora’s mind, and her body filled with strength. She understood that Sister Sage wished her to follow in silence, and that she must do whatever this sister asked.</p>
<p class="x1BM">As they walked down the corridor Flora noticed how every bee averted her eyes and busied herself, and how the dead body of the young worker was already far ahead of them, carried in the mouth of a dark, hunched bee who walked in the gutter. There were many more of the same type, all moving on the edge of the corridor. Some carried bundles of soiled wax, others scrubbed at broken cells. None looked up.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“They are your kin-sisters.” Sister Sage followed Flora’s eyes. “All of them mute. Presently you will join them in Sanitation, and perform valuable service to our hive. But first, a private experiment.” She smiled at Flora. “Come.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora followed gladly, all memory of the killing lost in her longing to taste more honey.</p>
