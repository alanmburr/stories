<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">B</span><span class="smallCaps">Y THE NEXT MORNING MANY BEES HAD NOT THE</span> heart to rise from their berths, while others had lost their minds and ran in circles buzzing and babbling or beating their antennae against the comb until they broke. The fertility police took all of them away. The rest, almost eight thousand motherless daughters, wandered desolately through the hive, unable to settle to anything, for without the Queen’s Love no task had meaning.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Pollen dough dried on patisserie tables, chalices of nectar stood unfanned. Sisters in the Chapel of Wax could not pray, and in the Nursery the nannies could not comfort those ceaselessly crying infants who had survived the purge of foulbrood.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Most frightening of all was the plight of the foragers. Again and again they went to the landing board, but despite the good weather not one could start her engine, for that required joy and courage.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Tomorrow,” they said to each other. “Tomorrow, in good heart,” for to fly in sadness was to make mistakes and die—and the hive could bear no more losses.</p>
<p class="x1BM">At midday the canteens were closed, and at each a Sage priestess stood with a police guard.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Two days of fasting,” the holy sisters told the bees, “in purification before our princess comes.” And then they smiled and let their Sage kin-scent rise strong. <span class="italic">“Accept, Obey, and Serve.”</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“Accept, Obey, and Serve,”</span> responded the bees, breathing in the scent’s new opiate element. The smell of the Sage was calming and dulled their fear, and as they walked away from the canteens, they told each other a fast was good and would cleanse them. It also weakened them, so to conserve their energy for flight, most foragers sought solace in sleep.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora was lying in her berth at the back of the sanitation workers’ section, when she heard a dim murmur of voices and smelled the kin of Teasel. A group of them had gathered, concealed behind the strong scent of the sanitation workers. Flora lay back again. She did not care what they were doing there, nor had she the slightest intention of reporting them to Sister Sage, as she had once promised to do should she see them in conclave. All she could think about was the Queen’s Library, and what came next after <span class="italic">The Golden Leaf</span>.</p>
<p class="x1BM">There was a sixth story. She had walked right up to it, and then . . . But the more Flora concentrated the more tired she felt, until all she could hear were the murmurs of the Teasel, whispering like wind in the trees.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="smallCaps">Morning brought sharp</span> <span class="smallCaps">cold air</span> and a rime of frost on the landing board. The hungry house bees hurried into the lobbies to start fanning their wings for warmth, but their strength was low from fasting and the temperature did not change. Foragers ran to the landing board and shivered as they looked out at a thick white sky. Yesterday it had been warm and blue, and they had wasted it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“But we have Clustered!” someone cried. “Winter is <span class="italic">over</span>!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Tell the sky,” said another. “Tell the new buds, who surely die.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora looked out. <span class="italic">Winter comes twice.</span> Her hands went to her belly, and in immediate answer, the pulse of life beat hard against them. She gasped in joy. <span class="italic">One. More. Egg.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">“</span>Excuse me, Sister.” A Daisy forager unlatched her wings and stepped out around Flora and onto the board. “Enough talk of death!” She forced a smile. “Tomorrow comes the new Queen—so today I will fetch nectar to welcome her.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“And I,” many foragers shouted. They set their engines high and took off over the apple trees, but within a few seconds the cold seized their engines and they lost altitude. On the landing board the bees watched their little dark shapes whirl helplessly in the freezing wind. Flecks of snow blew into the hive, and the Thistle guards closed the landing board.</p>
<p class="x1BM"> </p>
<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="smallCaps">Energized by joy</span> <span class="smallCaps">and fear,</span> Flora ran back inside. Her grief and apathy had gone and she needed to move her body. If it was not possible to fly, then she would work with her kin-sisters, sheltered by their warmth and kindness—and their very strong scent.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“It will not last,” said the Sage priestesses in cheerful voices as they went about the hive swinging their censers filled with a strange fragrance. “By the time the new Queen arrives, the sun herself will come to greet her.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Tomorrow,” was all the bees dared whisper to each other, breathing in the new scent. As she scrubbed the midlevel lobby floor with her kin-sisters, this new smell made Flora feel sick. Glazed with a top note of honey and bound by the complex scent structure of the Melissae, it referenced every kin except flora, and its message was simple and clear: <span class="italic">Strength in Sage</span>. Some of the bees even murmured it without knowing, and as they passed, the priestesses smiled.</p>
<p class="x1BM">The scent forced its way into Flora’s spiracles, and then her bloodstream. It made her head hurt and sent shooting pains through her belly. Nauseous, she excused herself and ran down to the bottom story, intending to flush her body with cold fresh air near the landing board.</p>
<p class="x1BM">She got as far as the lobby outside the Dance Hall before the egg within her began to pulse. Sage priestesses were within, and Flora hurried away. Footsteps and voices came from all sides and now she did not know where to go. This egg had grown so quickly and given no warning—and now with frightening force it pushed at her body, telling her it was coming. She could smell the cold rain falling outside on the landing board and she longed to breathe more fresh air, but she had not a second to lose, for her body was opening to lay.</p>
<p class="x1BM">She could not go up to the busy midlevel, nor into the Dance Hall, so in desperation Flora ran down the dark corridor that smelled of propolis disinfectant. It was marked out of bounds since the Cluster because it was where the dead mouse lay embalmed, but the swelling egg left no time for choice. Covered in the scent of propolis, Flora dropped to the raw wax floor as the egg pressed her body apart. It came so fast and the pain was so startling that she could not even cry out—and then it was done. Gasping, Flora turned around.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Like her two other eggs before, this third one had a pearly skin and in its depths held a tiny point of light. Unlike them, it did not lie on its side, but balanced on its narrower tip, as if supported by some invisible force. It was also very large. Flora moved her body to block it from the corridor entrance, then feathered its skin in wonder. She could feel its radiant life-force warming her as she touched it.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Madness and disaster.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora raised her claw over her egg, as if the Minerva spider scuttled in the darkness—but all was still. Above her loomed the vast propolis tomb of the mouse, and the only thing that moved was a cold curl of air, coming from behind it. Flora raised her antennae. The hive creaked in the wind, and the air moved with it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">She knew what had happened—in their Cluster-dulled state, the defending bees had completely sealed the mouse to the hive floor—but when it was done they forgot the gap it had gnawed in the hive wall. Flora listened for footsteps. If the fertility police were coming, she would fight them to the death to protect this egg.</p>
<p class="x1BM">There was no sound, and she put her claws down. She breathed deeply, realizing the thick propolis veils would cover the scent of an egg even better than that of her own kin-sisters.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora flushed fresh air through her spiracles to rid herself of the controlling scent of Sage. Her brain cleared. It was cold in here, and her egg needed protection. In one more day the new Queen would come and start laying. Surely in all the excitement there would be opportunity to smuggle one new egg into the Nursery. Until then, she must protect it.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora bent herself forward and stared at her dry abdominal bands, harder and older since she had last looked. There was no trace of those soft, sliding glands that would give her wax, and she knew that since the Queen’s death, her prayers were as dry as her belly. She concentrated—but there was not one single synapse of response. The strong smell of propolis made it hard to think what she should do.</p>
<p class="x1BM"><span class="italic">Propolis.</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Flora looked at the sarcophagus of the mouse, hurriedly built with great lumps and crags sticking out of it. It was not wax, but made from the blood of a thousand trees, it had its own ancient purity. A sister with the strength and endurance to work it could mold it as she chose.</p>
<p class="x1BM">It was night before Flora had finished her task. The hive was silent, and her jaws ached from chewing, but the amber walls of the crib glowed with the spark of life within. Flora’s tongue was numb from the long contact with propolis, and no pulse of Flow lit her cheeks. Her time in the Nursery was so long ago, she struggled to remember how many days before an egg hatched. <span class="italic">Three</span> <span class="italic">sun bells chimed—</span></p>
<p class="x1BM">Three days—Flora was sure of it. And then the pearly skin would molt to reveal her baby, beautiful and hungry for Flow. She cleaned the crumbs of propolis off her fur in preparation for returning to her dormitory. The new Queen was coming tomorrow, and the anxious fast would be over. In the time of celebrations she would let herself feed and love her baby, then she would smuggle him into the Nursery—and this time, put him in the right section. She would make no more mistakes.</p>
<p class="x1BM">Not until she was lying safe and quiet in her dormitory berth, surrounded by the reassuring kin-scent of her sleeping sisters, did Flora become aware that her heartbeat had an echo, as if a tiny second heart pumped inside it. She hugged herself in silent joy, for even though she was one floor above, and on the other side of the hive, she knew that it was her connection to her living egg, growing stronger with every pulse of her blood.</p>
