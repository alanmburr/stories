<p class="x1BM-FIRST"><span class="dropcaps">T</span><span class="smallCaps">HE APPLE TREES WERE IN FULL BLOOM AS THE MAN, HIS</span> wife, and their two teenage children came through the orchard. They paused near the old hive. The man let a long coil of black ribbon unspool from his hand.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“So, this is a condition of Grandpa’s will. It’s from the olden days, when people thought the bees needed to be told important family news. Births, deaths, and marriages.” The man unfolded a piece of paper. “He even wrote it all out.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">Then he stepped forward to the hive and tied the black ribbon around it, before knocking on it softly, three times.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“It is my sad duty to inform you,” he read, “that your beekeeper, my father, has died. He will no longer be taking care of you, and he asks you to be patient with your new custodian.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The tone in his voice made his wife put her arms around him. He held her as he folded the paper back into his pocket, then addressed the hive again.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“And I have something else to say, for myself. I am very sorry that I have sold this orchard, and—I ask your forgiveness for what will happen.” He wiped his eyes.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Dad.” His daughter crouched down and put her ear against the hive. “Listen.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Careful!” But he too crouched down and put his ear to the wood. They looked at each other. Then he moved around and looked into the hole on the landing board. His wife drew back.</p>
<p class="x1BM">“Please, both of you, be careful—”</p>
<p class="x1BM">“I can’t hear a thing,” he said. “I cannot see a single bee.”</p>
<p class="x1BM">His son smiled. “Dad! They went with him!”</p>
<p class="x1BM">The family looked up into the bright and empty sky.</p>
