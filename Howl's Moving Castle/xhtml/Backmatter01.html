<p class="normall"><span><b>1. The Wizard Howl has charmed many readers across the world. What do you make of that?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>The one big, strange fact about Howl is that almost every young woman who reads about him wants to marry him. They began wanting to before the book was even published and they all confess their wish quite openly. Yesterday I was doing a question-and-answer session in a London theatre and a teenage girl put her hand up and said&mdash;without any embarrassment at all&mdash;that she had long wanted to marry Howl and would I mind. I wondered whether to ask her if <i>she</i> would mind everywhere being covered with green slime when Howl's hair went wrong; or if she minded coping with a man who had head colds like a drama queen; or being twisted round Howl's little finger; or would it worry her that the man was a terrible coward; or always falling in love with other women; or â€¦ But I could see she regarded these facts as a challenge. So I sat with my mouth open for a second and then told her that she had now joined the end of a very long line that stretches at least once around the world.</span></p>
<p class="bodytextl"><span>This didn't appear to trouble her unduly.</span></p>
<p class="bodytextl"><span>My opinion of Howl is that, much as I love him, he is the last person I would want to marry. Apart from anything else, I would want to get in the bathroom sometimes. See what you think when you read this book.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>2. You say on the dedication page that a young boy gave you the idea for the Moving Castle, but did it spring into your mind fully formed or take time to develop?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>When the boy gave me the idea of a Moving Castle, I knew at once that I would want to write about it, but it took a long time to decide how. I needed to discover Howl and Sophie first. This didn't happen for about three years, by which time I had totally forgotten the safe place where I had put the boy's name and address.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>3. Why do you think Howl, Sophie, and Calcifer make such a spectacular team?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>Howl, Sophie, and Calcifer make a very good team (in spite of disagreeing violently from time to time) because they all have strong magic, which they use in quite different ways. Howl is dashing and original&mdash;and vain and quirky of course&mdash;where Sophie is quite practical and good at covering up Howl's dashing blunders. Calcifer is very fond of Sophie because she released him from his contract with Howl and, in addition, gave him one thousand years of life (as a shooting star he should have died long ago). So he will back Sophie up whatever she does. But Calcifer and Howl, because they have been almost one person for some years in the past, work wonderfully together as a team, at double strength. Between them, they can do almost anything magical.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>4. The characters in <i>Howl's Moving Castle, Castle in the Air,</i> and <i>House of Many Ways</i> must word their wishes and spells very carefully. Is it important that magic not be too easy?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>Magic is not easy, although it seems it should be. You have to think through carefully what you need your magic to do, otherwise some tiny spell might have disastrous consequences. For instance, if you were to make two and two add up to three instead of four, you would change the way the whole universe works and it is quite possible that everyone would die of it. So you have to make your magic very precise. Howl knows this, and so does Calcifer, but Sophie is not always so careful.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>5. Doors that open onto many different places figure prominently in Howl's world. What makes doorways so powerful and mysterious?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>Doors are very powerful things. Things are different on either side of them. This applies not only to magic portals, where you might find a whole other world when you open the portal, or the kingdom of the dead, or even heaven or hell; but it applies to quite ordinary doors too. Your front door gives you the street (you hope!) and your back door may well give you a garden, and indoors you open a door into another room. But there is always the possibility that it will be a street you have never seen before, a garden that belongs to Bluebeard or someone, or a room that is in some other house entirely. In Howl's world, since this is a magic world, these possibilities actually come to be true a lot of the time. But there is no guarantee that it is not like this in our own world too. In my home, I always leave most doors open, just to prevent another place suddenly turning up on the other side of them.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>6. Were you surprised by Hayao Miyazaki's vision of the castle and characters of <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i>?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>I was surprised by Miyazaki's Moving Castle, because I had not thought of the castle having feet. In the book I wrote, the castle is more like a hovercraft and floats an inch or so above the ground. But I am very fond of Miyazaki's castle. I have several models of it around the house. As for Howl and Sophie, both of them are gentler and more noble than the characters in my books. But I wasn't surprised by this. Movies are always different. I have several models of Howl and Sophie around the house too, and quite a few Calcifers, one of which sits in the fireplace.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>7. Howl doesn't appear in his usual, perfectly groomed form in most of <i>Castle in the Air</i> or <i>House of Many Ways.</i> Did you know that as you began writing those two books, or was it a surprise?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>I was not surprised that Howl was different in <i>Castle in the Air</i> and <i>House of Many Ways.</i> Both books started out, more or less, by my imagining what Howl might be like if he were in another shape and wondering how his personality would come through then. The fact is, his shape may change, but his personality is always the same vain and impulsive one, with a tendency to do the opposite of what you might expect.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>8. None of the heroes in these books are conventional ones; in fact, they are all quite flawed. Is a hero more compelling when he or she isn't too perfect?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>I think people who don't have faults are very boring. Your faults are a large part of what you are <i>like</i> as a person. And my aim is always to make what I write interesting. If I can't be interested in people with no faults, then neither can you. Charmain interested me because she is both very fierce and a bookworm&mdash;and you must admit that this is an odd combination. Peter interested me too because he is so madly sure of himself. And of course Howl is interesting because you never know what he's going to do next.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>9. Why do you think Howl has to trick himself into being brave? Or that so many other characters are almost unwillingly&mdash;or unknowingly&mdash;brave?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>Everyone has to trick him/herself into doing what they think is against their nature. Think of the many times you have promised yourself a treat of some kind once you have done a chore that you hate. This is the most normal way of tricking yourself. But how many times also have you sauntered over to the jar of cookies, telling yourself that you are not really going to eat one? This is another way of tricking yourself. Howl is an extreme case of this because he has convinced himself he is a terrible coward. The fact is that he is quite brave in some directions and only frightened when he is face to face with someone whose powers are equal to his own. Then he has to trick himself into dealing with them.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>10. The lands of Ingary, High Norland, and the Sultanates of Rashpuht are quite diverse. Did you know how large this world was when you wrote <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i>?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>When I wrote <i>Howl's Moving Castle,</i> I knew that the land of Ingary, being the land where fairy stories are true, could not be the only country in this world. There are so many such stories and they are very diverse. But I only set out to explore some of them later, when I wanted to see more of Howl. There are, of course, many more countries to explore.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>11. We see some of Howl and Sophie's life in <i>Castle in the Air</i> and <i>House of Many Ways</i>, but do you have an idea of what a typical day in their happily ever after is like?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>A typical day in the life of Howl and Sophie? Well, there would be at least two quarrels, one violent argument, and an explosion of strange magic. They are not a quiet pair.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>12. What sparked you to write <i>House of Many Ways?</i></b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>What sparked me to write <i>House of Many Ways</i> was a silly thing: I have a friend who never does her laundry. And is then amazed at the way the bags of laundry multiply. In the actual book, the laundry is only a small feature, but it was what sparked the book off. And if you notice, it multiplies every day.</span></p>
<p class="normall"><span><b>13. Can we look forward to any more stories involving Howl in the future?</b></span></p>
<p class="normall"><span>I hope we can look forward to more Howl stories. There is already one I keep trying to write and which, so far, will not come out right. But I hope I can crack it in the end.</span></p>
