<p class="ata"><span>In a career spanning four decades, award-winning author Diana Wynne Jones (1934â€“2011) wrote more than forty books of fantasy for young readers. Characterized by magic, multiple universes, witches and wizards&mdash;and a charismatic nine-lived enchanter&mdash;her books were filled with unlimited imagination, dazzling plots, and an effervescent sense of humor that earned her legendary status in the world of fantasy. In addition to being translated into more than twenty languages, her books have earned a wide array of honors&mdash;including two <i>Boston Globe-Horn Book</i> Award Honors and the Guardian Award&mdash;and appeared on countless best-of-the-year lists. Her best-selling <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> was made into an animated film by Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki and was nominated for an Academy Award. Diana Wynne Jones was also honored with many prestigious awards for the body of her work. She was given the British Fantasy Society's Karl Edward Wagner Award in 1999 for having made a significant impact on fantasy, and she won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Fantasy Convention in 2007.</span></p>
