<p class="normal"><span class="dropcap">W</span><small>ILL YOU ALL BE QUIET</small>!" snapped High Chancellor Querida. She pouched up her eyes and glared around the table.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I was only trying to say&mdash;" a king, an emperor, and several wizards began.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"At once," said Querida, "or the next person to speak spends the rest of his life as a snake!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">This shut most of the University Emergency Committee up. Querida was the most powerful wizard in the world, and she had a special feeling for snakes. She looked like a snake herself, small and glossy-skinned and greenish, and very, very old. Nobody doubted she meant what she said. But two people went on talking, anyway. Gloomy King Luther murmured from the end of the table, "Being a snake might be a relief." And when Querida's eyes darted around at him, he stared glumly back, daring her to do it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And Wizard Barnabas, who was vice chancellor of the University, simply went on talking. </p>
<p class="bodytext">". . . trying to say, Querida, that you don't understand what it's like. You're a woman. You only have to be the Glamorous Enchantress. Mr. Chesney won't let women do the Dark Lord." Querida's eyes snapped around at him with no effect at all. Barnabas gave her a cheerful smile and puffed a little. His face seemed designed for good humor. His hair and beard romped around his face in gray curls. He looked into Querida's pouched eyes with his blue, bloodshot ones and added, "We're all worn out, the lot of us."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Hear, hear!" a number of people around the table muttered cautiously.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I know that!" Querida snapped. "And if you'd listen, instead of all complaining at once, you'd hear me saying that I've called this meeting to discuss how to put a stop to Mr. Chesney's Pilgrim Parties for good."</p>
<p class="bodytext">This produced an astonished silence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A bitter little smile put folds in Querida's cheeks. "Yes," she said. "I'm well aware that you elected me high chancellor because you thought I was the only person ruthless enough to oppose Mr. Chesney and that you've all been very disappointed when I didn't immediately leap at his throat. I have, of course, been studying the situation. It is not easy to plan a campaign against a man who lives in another world and organizes his tours from there." Her small green-white hands moved to the piles of paper, bark, and parchment in front of her, and she began stacking them in new heaps, with little dry, rustling movements. "But it is clear to me," she said, "that things have gone from bad, to intolerable, to crisis point, and that something must be done. Here I have forty-six petitions from all the male wizards attached to the University and twenty-two from other male magic users, each pleading chronic overwork. This pile is three letters signed by over a hundred female wizards, who claim they are being denied equal rights. They are accurate. Mr. Chesney does not think females can be wizards." Her hands moved on to a mighty stack of parchments with large red seals dangling off them. "This," she said, "is from the kings. Every monarch in the world has written to me at least once protesting at what the tours do to their kingdoms. It is probably only necessary to quote from one. King Luther, perhaps you would care to give us the gist of the letter I receive from you once a month?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Yes, I would," said King Luther. He leaned forward and gripped the table with powerful blue-knuckled hands. "My kingdom is being ravaged," he said. "I have been selected as Evil King fifteen times in the last twenty years, with the result that I have a tour through there once a week, invading my court and trying to kill me or my courtiers. My wife has left me and taken the children with her for safety. The towns and countryside are being devastated. If the army of the Dark Lord doesn't march through and sack my city, then the Forces of Good do it next time. I admit I'm being paid quite well for this, but the money I earn is so urgently needed to repair the capital for the next Pilgrim Party that there is almost none to spare for helping the farmers. They hardly grow anything these days. You must be aware, High Chancellor&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Querida's hand went to the next pile, which was of paper, in various shapes and sizes. "I am aware, thank you, Your Majesty. These letters are a selection of those I get from farmers and ordinary citizens. They all state that what with magical weather conditions, armies marching over crops, soldiers rustling cattle, fires set by the Dark Lord's minions, and other hazards, they are likely to starve for the foreseeable future." She picked up another smallish pile of paper. "Almost the only people who seem to be prospering are the innkeepers, and they complain that the lack of barley is making it hard to brew sufficient ale."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"My heart bleeds," King Luther said sourly. "Where would we be if a Pilgrim Party arrived at an inn with no beer?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Mr. Chesney would not be pleased," murmured a high priest. "May the gods defend us, Anscher preserve us from that!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Chesney's only a man," muttered the delegate from the Thieves Guild.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Don't let him hear you say that!" Barnabas said warningly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Of course he's only a man," snapped Querida. "He just happens to be the most powerful man in the world, and I've taken steps to ensure that he cannot hear us inside this council chamber. Now may I go on? Thank you. We are being pressured to find a solution by several bodies. Here"&mdash;she picked up a large and beautifully lettered parchment with paintings in the margins&mdash;"is an ultimatum from Bardic College. They say that Mr. Chesney and his agents appear to regard all bards with the tours as expendable. Rather than lose any more promising musicians, they say here, they are refusing to take part in any tours this year, unless we can guarantee the safety of&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"But we can't!" protested a wizard two places down from Barnabas.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"True," said Querida. "I fear the bards are going to have to explain themselves to Mr. Chesney. I also have here similar but more moderate letters from the seers and the healers. The seers complain that they have to foresee imaginary events and that this is against the articles of their guild, and the healers, like the wizards, complain of chronic overwork. At least they only threaten not to work this year. And here"&mdash;she lifted up a small ragged pile of paper&mdash;"here are letters from the mercenary captains. Most of them say that replacements to manpower, equipment, and armor cost them more than the fees they earn from the Pilgim Parties, and this one on top from&mdash;Black Gauntlet, I think the man's name is&mdash;also very feelingly remarks that he wants to retire to a farm, but he has not in twenty years earned enough for one coo&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"One what?" said King Luther.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Cow. He can't spell," said Barnabas.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"&mdash;even if there were any farms where he would be safe from the tours," said Querida. She shuffled more papers, saying as she shuffled, "Pathetic letters from nuns, monks, werewolves. Where are&mdash;? Oh, yes, here." She picked up a white sheet that glowed faintly and a large pearly slice of what seemed to be shell, covered with faint marks. "Probably one of their old scales," she remarked. "These are protests from the elves and the dragons."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"What have they got to complain of?" another wizard asked irritably.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Both put it rather obscurely," Querida confessed. "I think the Elfking is talking about blackmail and the dragons seem to be bewailing the shrinking of their hoards of treasure, but both of them seem to be talking about their birthrate, too, so one cannot be sure. You can all read them in a short while, if you wish, along with any other letters you want. For now, have I made my point?" Her pouchy eyes darted to look at everyone around the long table. "I have asked everyone I can think of to tell me how the tours affect them. I have received over a million replies. My study is overflowing with them, and I invite you all to go and inspect it. What I have here are only the most important. And the important thing is that they all, in different ways, say the same thing. They want an end to Mr. Chesney's Pilgrim Parties."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"And have you thought of a way to stop them?" Barnabas asked eagerly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No," said Querida. "There is no way."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"What?" shouted almost everyone around the table.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"There is no way," Querida repeated, "that I can think of. Perhaps I should remind you that Mr. Chesney's decisions are supported by an extremely powerful demon. All the signs are that he made a pact with it when he first started the tours."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Yes, but that was forty years ago," objected the young Emperor of the South. "Some of us weren't born then. Why should I have to keep on doing what that demon made my grand-father do?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Don't be foolish," Querida snapped. "Demons are immortal."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"But Mr. Chesney isn't," argued the young Emperor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Possibly he isn't, but I've heard he has children being groomed to take over after him," Barnabas said sadly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Querida's eyes darted to the Emperor in venomous warning. "Don't speak like that outside this room. Mr. Chesney does not like to hear anyone being less than enthusiastic about his Pilgrims, and we do not mention the demon. Have I made myself plain?" The young Emperor swallowed and sat back. "Good," said Querida. "Now, to business. The tour agents have been in this world for over a month, and the arrangements for this year's tours are almost complete. Mr. Chesney is due here himself tomorrow to give the Dark Lord and the Wizard Guides their final briefings. The purpose of this meeting is supposed to be to appoint this year's Dark Lord."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Heavy sighs ran around the table. "All right," said one of the wizards, out of the general dejection. "Who is it to be? Not me. I did it last year."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Querida gave her sour little smile, folded her hands, and sat back. "I have no idea," she said blandly. "I have no more idea who is to be Dark Lord than I have about how to stop the tours. I propose that we consult the Oracles."</p>
<p class="bodytext">There was a long, thoughtful silence. Relieved shiftings began around the table as even the slowest of the people there realized that Querida was, after all, trying to find a way out. At last the high priest said dubiously, "Madam Chancellor, I understood that the Oracles were set up for Mr. Chesney by wizards of the University&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"And by a former high priest, who asked the gods to speak through the Oracles," Querida agreed. "Is that any reason why they shouldn't work, Reverend Umru?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Well," said the high priest. "Er. Mightn't the Oracles, in that case, be . . . well . . . biased?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Probably," said Querida. "For that reason, I propose to ask both the White Oracle and the Black Oracle. They will say two different things, and we will do them both."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Er," said High Priest Umru. "Two Dark Lords?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"If necessary," said Querida. "Anything it takes." She pushed back her chair and stood up. Because she was so small, this kept her head at exactly the same height. Her small, lizardlike chin jutted as she looked around the table. "We can't all go to the Oracles," she said, "and some of you look far too tired. I shall take a representative body. King Luther, I think, and Barnabas, you come. And you, High Priest Umru&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Umru stood up and bowed, with his hands clasped across his large belly. "Madam Chancellor, I would hate to be selected on false pretenses. I am probably one of the few people here who does not object to the Pilgrim Parties. My temple has prospered exceedingly out of them over the years."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I know," said Querida. "You people keep taking me for a fool. I want you as a representative of the other point of view, of course. And I'll take you, too, for the same reason." Her hand darted out like a snake's tongue to point at the delegate from the Thieves Guild.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He was a young man, thin and fair and clever-looking. He was extremely surprised. "Me?" he said. "Are you sure?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"What a silly question," Querida said. "Your guild must have made a mint from the Pilgrims, one way and another."</p>
<p class="bodytext">A strange expression crossed the face of the thief, but he got up without a word. His clothing was as rich as that of the high priest. His long silk sleeves swirled as he walked gracefully around the table. "Aren't the Oracles in the Distant Desert?" he asked. "How do we go?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"By a translocation spell I have already set up," Querida said. "Come over here, the four of you." She led the way to the empty part of the room, where one of the large flagstones in the floor could be seen to have faint marks around its edges. "The rest of you can start reading those letters while we're away," she said. "And I'll need a name for you," she told the young thief.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh . . . Regin," he said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Stand here," Querida said, pushing him to one corner of the flagstone. She pushed King Luther, Barnabas, and High Priest Umru to each of the other corners and slithered between Umru and King Luther to stand in the center of the stone herself. From the point of view of the people still sitting at the table, she vanished entirely behind Umru's belly. Then, quietly and without warning, all five of them vanished and the flagstone was bare.</p>
<p class="bodytext">From the point of view of the four people with Querida, it was like suddenly stepping into an oven&mdash;an oven that was probably on fire, King Luther thought, shielding his eyes with his stout woolen sleeve. Sweat ran out from under Barnabas's curls. Umru gasped and staggered and then tried wretchedly to get sand out of his embroidered slippers and loosen his vestments at the same time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Only Querida was perfectly happy. She said, "Ah!" and stretched, turning her face up to the raging sun with a blissful smile. Her eyes, the young thief noticed, were wide open and looking straight into the sun. Wizards! he thought. He was as uncomfortable as the other three, but he had been trained to seem cool and keep his wits about him. He looked around. The Oracles were only a few yards away. They were two small domed buildings, the one on the left so black that it looked like a hole in the universe, and the one on the right so dazzlingly white that sweat ran stinging into his eyes and he had to look away from it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">While they waited for the other three to recover, Querida took Regin's arm and pulled him across the sand, toward the white building. "Why did you look so oddly when I said your guild must have made a mint from the tours?" she hissed up at him. "Does that mean you want the tours stopped, too?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Trust her to notice! the thief thought ruefully. "Not exactly, Madam Chancellor. But if you think about it, you'll see that after forty years we haven't got much else to steal. We're debating stealing from one another, and even if we did, there's nothing much left to spend what we steal on. Actually, I was sent to ask whether it was permissible to steal from the Pilgrims."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Don't you steal from tourists?" Querida asked. When he shook his head, another blissful grin spread over Querida's little lizard face. "Do you know, I believe that must be one thing that Mr. Chesney forgot to put in his rules. By all means, start stealing from tourists." Her face darted around toward Umru, who was now mopping his head with his embroidered cope. "Come along, man! Don't just stand there! Come along, all of you, before you fry. We'll begin with the White Oracle."</p>
<p class="bodytext">She led the way to the white building. Regin followed, stepping lightly in his soft boots, although sweat trickled past his ears. King Luther and Barnabas trudged glumly after them. Umru floundered behind and had some trouble fitting through the narrow white doorway.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Inside, it was dark and beautifully cool. They stood in a row looking into a complete darkness that seemed to take up much more space than such a small building could hold.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"What do we do?" King Luther asked.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Wait," said Querida. "Watch."</p>
<p class="bodytext">They waited. After a while, as happens when you stare into total darkness, they all thought they could see dots, blobs, and twirling patterns. Sun dazzle, King Luther thought. Trick of the eyeballs, Regin thought. Take no notice. Means nothing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">All at once the seeming dazzles gathered purposefully together. It was impossible to think they meant nothing. In a second or so they definitely formed the shape of something that might have been human, though swirling and too tall, composed of dim reds and sullen blues and small flashes of green. A soft, hollow voice, with a lot of echoes behind it, said, Speak your question, mortals.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Thank you," Querida said briskly. "Our question is this: What do we do to abolish the Pilgrim Parties and get rid of Mr. Chesney for good?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">The swirling shape dived, mounted to something twenty feet high, and then shrank to something Querida's size, weaving this way and that. It seemed agitated. But the hollow voice, when it spoke, was the same as before: You must appoint as Dark Lord the first person  you see on leaving here.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Much obliged," said Querida.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Quite suddenly the little temple was not dark at all. It was a very small space, hardly big enough for the five of them, with bare white walls and a floor of drifted sand in which bits of rubbish could be seen, evidently dropped by other people who had been to consult the White Oracle. There were scraps of paper, a small shoe, buckles, straps, and plum stones. Something flashed, half buried in the sand by the toes of Regin's boots. While everyone was turning to go out, he stooped and picked it deftly up and then paused in surprise with the rest of them, because the doorway was no longer narrow. It was now wide enough for all five of them to walk out side by side. They stepped forward into the heat again, blinking at empty miles of glaring desert.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No one here," said Querida.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I suppose it'll be the first person we see when we get back then," Barnabas said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Regin looked at what he had picked up. It was a strip of cloth. There were black letters printed on it that read: Be careful what you ask for; you may get it. He passed it silently to King Luther, who was nearest.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Now it warns us!" said King Luther, and passed it to Umru.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"This is something I often tell my flock," Umru said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Wizards know it, too," Barnabas said. He took the cloth and passed it to Querida. "We've been warned, Querida. Do you still want to consult the Black Oracle as well?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Of course I do. And I am always very careful what I ask for," Querida retorted. She led the way across the short distance to the black temple. The others looked at one another, shrugged, and followed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The black building breathed out cold from its surface. Umru sighed with relief as he came under its walls, but his teeth were actually chattering slightly by the time it was his turn to squeeze through the narrow entrance. Inside, he moaned miserably, because it was as hot in there as the desert outside. He stood puffing and panting in deep darkness while, just as before, dazzles and blobs gathered in front of their eyes.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We wait for them to gather, Regin thought wisely. But this time, instead of gathering, the twirling dazzles retreated, swirling away to the sides and glowing more and more strongly. It took all the watchers a full minute to realize that the darkness left behind was now the shape of a huge nearly human figure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh, I see!" muttered Querida.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You do? said a great, hollow voice. It was deep as a coal mine. Then ask.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Thank you," said Querida, and just as before, she asked, "What do we do to abolish the Pilgrim Parties and get rid of Mr. Chesney for good?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">There was a long, long silence. The darkness remained absolutely still while the silence lasted and then abruptly quivered and broke up, with shoots of light rushing through it from either side. When it spoke again, the deep voice shook a little.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You must appoint as Wizard Guide to the last tour the second person you see on leaving here.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, as in the white temple, the space was small and empty and they were crowded together, standing among rubbish. It was slightly less hot.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I swear that thing was laughing!" Barnabas said as they turned to go and found, as before, that the doorway was now wide enough to take all of them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Something glittered in the sand by Regin's boot. This time he did not pick it up. He put his toe under it and nudged it until he could see that it was a scrap of paper with one gold edge. Sure enough, it had written on it: Be careful what you ask for; you may get it. He decided not to mention it to the others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Well, the desert's still empty," said King Luther. "Oh!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">A man was just coming out of the temple of the White Oracle. He was a tall, fattish, mild-faced man, dressed in the kind of clothes farmers wore. He was edging sideways out of the narrow entrance with one arm up to shade his eyes, but they could all see his face quite clearly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Barnabas said, "Oh, no!" and King Luther said, "I'll be damned!" Umru shook his head. "Be careful what you ask for," he sighed. Querida drew in a little hiss of breath.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"What's the matter?" asked Regin. "Who is he? Who are they, I mean?" he added as someone else squeezed out of the white doorway behind the wide man. This person was a boy of about fourteen who looked rather like the man, except that he was skinny where the man was wide. As Regin asked, the man rounded on the boy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"There," he said. "You're answered. Satisfied?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No, I am not!" said the boy. "I've never heard of this person. Who is he?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Goodness knows," replied the man. "But he's no one at the University, so it's quite clear you're not going to the University to learn your wizardry, anyway. I was right."</p>
<p class="bodytext">The boy's chin bunched angrily. "There's no need to look so pleased. You always try to stop me doing what I want!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the two of them stood in the sand and shouted at one another.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Who are they?" Regin asked again.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I don't know the boy," Querida said, "but I know the man all right. His name is Derk. And he did once qualify at the University as a wizard. There is no doubt Mr. Chesney would accept him as Dark Lord."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"The boy's his son," Barnabas said. "His name's Blade. Querida, I don't want to do this. Derk is a nice man and a friend of mine. He's actually very gifted&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"There are two opinions about that," Querida snapped. "Has the boy any talent?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Bags of it," Barnabas said miserably. "Takes after his mother."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh&mdash;Mara, I remember," Querida said. "I must talk to Mara. That's settled then. We have our Dark Lord and our Wizard Guide according to both the Oracles."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"We could always pretend we hadn't seen them and choose the next two people we see," King Luther suggested.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"The gods forfend!" Umru gasped, mopping his face with his undercope.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Querida shot King Luther her snakiest look and marched over to the two outside the white temple. As she reached them, Derk was leaning forward to bawl into his son's face, with a wholly reasonable air, as if he were simply discussing something quietly, "I tell you, the University's not a place to learn anything these days. They haven't had a new idea for thirty years. All they do is crawl to Mr. Chesney."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Querida could easily pretend not to hear this, because Blade was at the same time screaming, "I don't want to hear! It's just excuses to stop me doing what I want! You let Shona go to Bardic College, so why don't you let me learn magic?"</p>
<p class="bodytext"><small>"ER, HEM!"</small> said Querida, loudly enlarged by magic.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Derk and Blade both whirled around. "Tyrant!" Blade screamed in her face, and then bowed over, consumed with embarrassment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Derk surveyed the tiny, glistening lady in the robes of high chancellor. His eyes traveled on to the tall, glum, sweaty figure of King Luther and the huge shape of Umru and the blisters of sweat popping out on his vast, red-blotched cheeks. He nodded to them and smiled at Barnabas, whose curls were wet and whose face was even redder than Umru's. Finally he looked at the young man in the rear, who was a stranger to him and only pretending not to be hot. "Oh, hello," he said. "What are you all doing here? Is there some reason you aren't using a refrigeration spell?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No, I forgot, bother it!" said Querida. "I like the heat."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Derk nudged Blade. Blade recovered from his embarrassment enough to make a slight gesture. Incredible, blessed coolness spread over the four men.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Bags of talent indeed," Regin murmured.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Thank you, young man," Umru said gratefully.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Blade was clearly intending to demonstrate that it was not usual for him to scream into people's faces. He bowed. "You're welcome, Your Reverence," he said with great politeness. "And&mdash;excuse me&mdash;do any of you know a wizard called Deucalion?" He looked round them anxiously as they all shrugged and shook their heads. "Magic user then?" he asked, with his voice dropping hopelessly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Never heard of anyone of that name, Blade," said Barnabas. "Why?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"He's the one the White Oracle says is going to train me as a wizard," Blade explained. "Dad's never heard of him either." He sighed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Querida swept this aside. "We, as it happens, have consulted the Oracles also," she said. "They have named you, Wizard Derk, as this year's Dark Lord and you, young Blade, as Wizard Guide to the last tour."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Now listen&mdash;" said Derk.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No arguing with the Oracles, Derk," Barnabas said quietly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"But&mdash;" said Blade.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Nor you, young man," said Querida. "Both of you are going to be very busy for the next six months."</p>
<p class="bodytext">At this Derk stirred himself, powerfully but a little uncertainly, and stood over Querida. "I don't think you can do this," he said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh, yes, I can," she said. "Go home and make ready. Tomorrow, at midday sharp, Mr. Chesney and all the Wizard Guides and I will be arriving at your house to brief you on this year's plans." When Derk still stood there, she gazed up at him like a cobra ready to strike and added, "In case you are planning to be away from home tomorrow, I must point out you are in a very poor position, Wizard Derk. You have not paid your wizard's dues to the University for fifteen years. This gives me the right to exact penalties."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I sent you a griffin's egg," Derk said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"It was addled," said Querida. "As I am sure you knew."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"And I couldn't send you anything else," Derk went on seriously. "All the products of my wizardry are alive. It would be criminal to shut them up in the University dues vault. You'd want to kill them and embalm them first. Besides, my wife has paid dues enough for two of us."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Mara's miniature universes are quite irrelevant to Mr. Chesney," Querida stated. "Be warned, Wizard Derk. Either you present yourself at Derkholm to Mr. Chesney and the rest of us tomorrow, or you have every magic user in this world looking for you to make you be Dark Lord. Do I make myself clear?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Blade pulled his father's arm. "Better go, Dad."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"And you, young man," said Querida. "You're to be there, too."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Blade succeeded in pulling his father around sideways, but Derk still looked down at Querida across his own shoulder. "No one should have this kind of power," he said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"To whom do you refer, Wizard?" she asked, still in her cobra stance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Chesney, of course," Derk said rather hastily.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Here Blade pulled harder, and the two of them disappeared in a stinging cloud of blown sand.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Phew!" said Barnabas. "Poor old Derk!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Let us go home more slowly," said Querida. "I feel a little tired."</p>
<p class="bodytext">The return journey was more like a lingering walk, in which they trod now on a patch of hot sand, now on wiry dead grass, now on rocks or moss. Regin put himself beside Querida as they went. "Who is this Wizard Derk?" he asked.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Querida sighed. "A shambles of a man. The world's worst wizard, to my mind."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh, come now, Querida," said Barnabas. "He's excellent at what he does&mdash;just a little unconventional, you know. When we were students together, I always thought he was twice as bright as me."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Querida shuddered. "Unconventional is a kind word for it. I was senior instructor then. Of all the things he did wrong, my worst memories are of being dragged up in the middle of the night to deal with that vast blue demon that Derk had called up and couldn't put down. You remember?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Barnabas nodded and bit his lip in order not to laugh. "Nobody knew its name, so none of the usual exorcisms worked. It took the entire staff of the University to get rid of it in the end. All through the night. Derk was never much good at conventional wizardry, I admit. But you use him a lot, don't you, Reverend?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Umru smiled sweetly, his fat, comfortable, cool self again. "I pay for Wizard Derk's services almost every time my temple has a tour party through. No one but Wizard Derk can make a convincing human corpse out of a dead donkey." Regin stared. Umru smiled ever more sweetly. "Or a sheep," he said. "We are always chosen as an evil priesthood, and the Pilgrims expect us to have a vilely tortured sacrifice to display. Wizard Derk saves us the necessity of using people."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh," said Regin. He turned to where King Luther was trudging grimly in the rear. "And you, Your Majesty? You know this wizard, too?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"We use him for hangings and heads on spikes occasionally," King Luther said. "But I hire him most often for the feast when the damn Pilgrims have gone. He has performing animals. Pigs mostly."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Pigs?" said Regin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Yes, pigs," said King Luther. "They fly."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh," Regin said again. As he said it, they arrived back on the flagstone in the council room again. Regin's teeth chattered; Barnabas was shivering; Umru was juddering all over. Querida was unaffected. So was King Luther, whose northern kingdom was never warm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"What is the matter?" Umru cried out. People turned from reading the heaps of letters on the table to stare at him. He held his hands out piteously. "Look. Blue!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh. Um," said Barnabas. "It's young Blade's fault, I'm afraid. Boys of that age never know their own strength. I'll do what I can, but it may take an hour or so."</p>
