<p class="dedication" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;"><span>The idea for this book was suggested by a boy in a school I was visiting, who asked me to write a book called <i>The Moving Castle.</i></span></p>
<p class="dedication" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;"><span>I wrote down his name, and put it in such a safe place, that I have been unable to find it ever since.</span></p>
<p class="dedication"><span>I would like to thank him very much.</span></p>
