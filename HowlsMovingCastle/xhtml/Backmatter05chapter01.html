<p class="normal"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he trouble started the day Howard came home from school to find the Goon sitting in the kitchen. It was Fifi who called him the Goon. Fifi was a student who lived in their house and got them tea when their parents were out. When Howard pushed Awful into the kitchen and slammed the door after them both, the first person he saw was Fifi, sitting on the edge of a chair, fidgeting nervously with her striped scarf and her striped leg warmers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Thank goodness you've come at last!" Fifi said. "We seem to have somebody's Goon. Look."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard looked the way Fifi's chin jerked and saw the Goon sitting in a chair by the dresser. He was filling most of the rest of the kitchen with long legs and huge boots. It was a knack the Goon had. The Goon's head was very small, and his feet were enormous. Howard's eyes traveled up a yard or so of tight faded jeans, jerked to a stop for a second at the knife with which the Goon was cleaning the dirty nails of his vast hands, and then traveled on over an old leather jacket to the little, round fair head in the distance. The little face looked half-daft.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard was in a bad mood anyway. That was Awful's fault. Awful had made him meet her coming out of school because, as she said, he was her big brother and supposed to look after her. When Howard got there, there was Awful racing out of the gates, chased by twenty angry little girls. Awful was shouting, "My big brother's here to hit you! Hit them, Howard!" Howard did not know what Awful had done to the other little girls, but knowing Awful, he suspected it was something bad. He objected to being used as Awful's secret weapon, but he did not feel he could let her down. He swung his bag menacingly, hoping that would frighten the little girls off. But there were so many of them and they were so angry that it had ended by being quite a fight. And the little girls called names. It was being called names that had put Howard in a bad mood. And now he came home to find it full of Goon.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He banged his bag down on the kitchen table. The Goon did not look up. "Who is <i>he</i> supposed to be?" Howard asked Fifi.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Fifi jittered nervously. "He just walked in and sat there," she said. "He says he's from Archer, whoever that is."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard was big for his age. On the other hand, so was the Goon big for whatever age he was. And the Goon had that knife. Howard thumped his bag on the table again. "Well, he can just go away," he said. It did not come out as fierce as he had hoped.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Here Awful put her word in. "You go away, Goon," she said. "Howard's bag's covered with the blood of little girls."</p>
<p class="bodytext">This seemed to interest the Goon. He stopped cleaning his nails and gave the bag a wondering look. He spoke, in a strong, daft voice. "Don't see any blood."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"And we don't know anyone called Archer!" Howard snapped.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon grinned, a daft, placid grin. "Your dad does," he said, and went back to cleaning his nails.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"He smells," said Awful. "Make him go. I want my tea."</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon did smell rather, a faint smell of gasoline and rotten eggs, which came in whiffs whenever he moved. Howard and Fifi exchanged helpless looks.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I want my <i>tea</i>!" Awful yelled, in the way that had earned her her name. Her real name was Anthea, but she had been Awful from the moment she was born and first opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The piercingness of Awful's yell seemed to get to the Goon. A slight quiver ran through the length of him, though it stopped before it got to his face. "Shut up," he said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Shan't," said Awful. The Goon's little face and daft round eyes turned to look at Awful. He seemed amazed. Awful looked back. She drew a deep, careful breath, opened her mouth, and screamed. Dad always said that scream had cleared clinics and emptied buses since Awful was a month old. Now she was eight it was truly horrible.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon cocked his small head and listened to it, almost appreciatively, for a second. Then he grinned. "Aw, shut up," he said, and threw his knife at Awful.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At least that was what seemed to happen. Something certainly zipped past Awful's screaming face. Awful ducked and stopped screaming at once. Something certainly flew on past Awful and landed <i>thuk</i> in Howard's bag on the table. After it had, the Goon went placidly back to cleaning his nails with what was obviously the selfsame knife.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard, Fifi, and Awful stared from the knife in the Goon's hands to the raw new rip in Howard's bag. Awful longed to scream again but did not quite dare. "How&mdash;how did he do that?" said Fifi. "He never moved!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon spoke again. "Know I mean business now," he said. He sounded rather smug.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"What business?" said Howard.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Stay here till I get satisfaction," said the Goon. "Told her before you came in." And he went on sitting, with his legs spread over most of the kitchen. It was plain he meant what he said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since there seemed no way of budging the Goon, Fifi and Howard began trying to get tea around the edges of him. This turned out to be impossible. The Goon took up too much space. They kept having to climb over his legs. The Goon made no attempt to stop them. On the other hand, he made no attempt to get his legs out of their way either.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Serve you right if I spill hot tea over you!" Howard said angrily.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon grinned. "Better not."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Or," said Howard, "if I trip, you could get a peanut butter sandwich in the face."</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon thought about this. Fifi interrupted hurriedly. "Would you like some tea, Goon? Tea in a cup, I mean, and a sandwich to hold in your hand?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Don't mind if I do," said the Goon. And he added, after thinking deeply again, "Not stupid, you know. Knew what you meant."</p>
<p class="bodytext">This was so clearly untrue that Fifi and Awful, scared though they were, spent the next ten minutes hanging on to each other trying not to laugh. Howard crossly pushed a mug of tea and a sandwich at the Goon. The Goon put his knife away and took them without a word. <i>Slurp,</i> he went at the tea, and he ate the sandwich without once closing his mouth. Howard had to look away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"But why have you come?" he burst out angrily. "Are you sure you've come to the right house?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon nodded. He gulped down the last of the sandwich and then got his knife out again to scrape bits of bread from between his teeth. "Your dad called Quentin Sykes?" he said around the sharp edge of it. "Writes books and things?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard nodded. His heart sank. Dad must have written something rude about this Archer person. It had happened before. "What's Dad done?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon jerked his little head at Fifi. "Told her. Sykes got behind with his payment. Archer wants his two thousand. Here to collect it."</p>
<p class="bodytext">The smiles were wiped off Fifi's and Awful's faces. "Two thousand!" Fifi exclaimed. "You never told me that!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Who <i>is</i> Archer?" said Howard.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon shrugged his huge shoulders. "Archer farms this part of town. Your dad pays, Archer doesn't make trouble." He grinned, almost sweetly, and sucked the last bit of bread off the point of his knife. "Got trouble now. Got me."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Phone the police," said Awful.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon's smile broadened. He took his knife by its point and wagged it at Awful. "Better not," he said. "Really bett'n't had." They exchanged looks again. It seemed to all of them, even Awful, that the Goon's advice was good. The Goon nodded when he saw them look and held his mug out for more tea. "Quite peaceful really," he remarked placidly. "Like this house. Civilized."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh, do you?" Howard said as Fifi filled the Goon's mug. "Just as well you like it because Dad won't be in for ages yet. It's his day for teaching at the Polytechnic."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Easily wait," the Goon said. "Does Mum know about Archer?" Awful asked.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No idea," said the Goon.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This had been worrying Howard, too. He was sure Mum did not know and would be very upset when she found out. She worried all the time about how short of money they were. He realized that he simply had to get the Goon out of the house before Mum came home. "Tell you what," he said. "Why don't you and I go along to the Poly? We can find Dad there and ask him."</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon's little head nodded. The grin he raised from drinking tea was big and sly. "You go," he said. "Me and the little girl stay here. Teach her some manners."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I'm not staying with <i>him</i>!" Awful said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Eat your tea," said Fifi. "We'd better all go, Howard."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"That suit you?" Howard asked the Goon.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon considered, idly scraping the point of his knife around his mug of tea. The noise made them all shiver. Chips and gouges of china fell out of the mug onto his faded jeans. That knife, Howard thought, must be made of something most unusual, something which could cut china and come back to you when it was thrown. "All go then," the Goon said at last. "All keep where I can see you." He put the scraped, carved mug on the floor and waited for Awful to finish eating. When she had, he stood up.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They found themselves backing away from him. He was even larger than they had thought. His little head grazed the ceiling. His long arms dangled. Fifi and Awful looked tiny beside him. Howard, who was used to finding himself as big as most people these days, suddenly felt small and skinny and feeble beside the Goon. He saw it was no good trying to run away when they got outside. They would have to trick the Goon somehow. He was obviously very stupid.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Fifi bravely rewrapped her scarf around her neck and crammed a striped hat on her head. She took hold of Awful's hand. "Don't worry," she said in a small, squeaky voice. "I'm here."</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon grinned down at her and calmly took hold of Awful's other hand. Awful dragged to get it free. When that made no impression at all, she said, "I'll bite you!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Bite you back," remarked the Goon. "Give you tetanus."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I think he means it," Fifi said in a faint squeak. "Don't annoy him, Awful."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Can't annoy me," said the Goon. "No one has yet." He must have gone on thinking about this while Howard was leading the way down the side passage into Upper Park Street. It was getting dark by then. The Goon's head seemed to get lost upward in the dusk. When Howard looked up, he could hardly see anything beyond the Goon's wide leather shoulders. "Funny," the Goon's voice came down. "Never been really angry. Wonder what would happen if I was."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I shudder to think!" Fifi said, more faintly than ever. "Howard, would you like to hold my other hand?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard was going to refuse indignantly. But it dawned on him in time that Fifi was scared stiff. So was he. When he took her hand in what was supposed to be a comforting grip, his hand was as cold and shaking as Fifi's. Joined in a line, they turned right and walked the short distance to the Poly. It could have been a shorter distance still, but Fifi took one look at the empty spaces of the park, and another, shuddering, at the gathering dark in Zed Alley and took the longer way around by the road and in through the main gate of the Poly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">By the time they got there bright strip lights were on in most of the windows of the Poly, and the forecourt, where the diggers were at work excavating for the new building, was well lit, too. There were a lot of people about, students hurrying home and men working on the site. It should have felt safe. But the Goon still had hold of Awful's hand, and none of them felt safe. Fifi cast longing looks at several people she knew, but she did not dare call out for help. Howard twitched at her hand, trying to tell her that they could give the Goon the slip inside the building. They could go up in the elevator, down the stairs, through the fire doors, up in the other elevators, and shake him off in the crowds. Then they could phone the police.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They went up the steps into the litter of paper cups in the foyer. Howard turned toward the elevators.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Don't be too clever," the Goon said. "Know where you live."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard turned around and looked up at him. The distant small face held the usual grin, but just for an instant, before Howard looked clearly, it did not look quite as daft as he had thought. In fact, he could have sworn the Goon looked almost clever. But when Howard looked properly, he realized that it was just a sort of slyness. That was bad enough. Howard changed direction and led them all up the stairs instead, to the room where Dad usually did his teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Dad was there. They heard his voice from behind the door, raised in a yell. "Good heavens, woman! I don't want to know what the Structuralists think! I want to know what <i>you</i> think!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Dad sounded busy. Howard raised one hand to knock at the door, but the Goon reached a long arm around him and tore the door open. Inside, there was a row of people sitting in metal chairs and holding note pads. They all turned irritably to look at the door. Quentin Sykes, propped on the back of another metal chair, turned around as irritably as the rest. He was smallish and fattish and barely came up to the Goon's armpit. But, as Howard knew, you could rely on Dad not to panic. Quentin went on looking at them irritably and raked his hands through the rather fluffy remains of his hair, while he took in the Goon, Howard's and Fifi's scared faces, and Awful's angry glower.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He turned back to his students. "Well, that about wraps it up for today," he said smoothly. "We'll save the Structuralist view for next week. Come in, all of you, and shut the door&mdash;you're making a draft. I think we'll ask Miss Potter to introduce next week's discussion, since she obviously knows so much about Structuralism." At this the thinnest woman with the largest note pad sat upright and stared in outrage. "The rest of you," Quentin Sykes said, before she could speak, "had better read these books in order to keep up with Miss Potter." And he rapidly recited a list of books. While the students, including Miss Potter, scribbled them down, Quentin took another look at the Goon. "See you all next week," he said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The students took a look at the Goon, too, and all decided to leave quickly. Everyone hurried out of the room, except for Miss Potter, who was still looking outraged. "Mr. Sykes," she said. "I really must complain&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Next week, Miss Potter. Put it all in your paper," Quentin said. "Show me how wrong I am."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miss Potter, looking more outraged than ever, squared her shoulders and marched out of the room. Howard hoped that Dad would be able to get rid of the Goon this easily, too.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Now what <i>is</i> this?" Quentin said, looking at the Goon.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Meet the Goon, Dad," said Howard.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon grinned, almost angelically. "Overdue payment," he said. "Came to collect two thousand."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"He just walked in, Mr. Sykes!" Fifi said angrily. "And he&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Quentin stopped Fifi by holding one hand up. It was a knack he seemed to have with students. "Nonsense," he said. "My payment isn't overdue."</p>
<p class="bodytext">It was the Goon's turn to hold one hand up, grinning still. Since he was still holding Awful's hand, Awful came up, too, dangling and yelling. He said something, but nothing could be heard but Awful. He had to shout it. "Should have had it two weeks ago! Archer's annoyed&mdash;" This was as far as the Goon got before Awful somehow managed to climb up her own arm and fasten her teeth in the Goon's knuckles. The Goon must have felt it. He turned to her reproachfully. "Drop you!" he shouted above the noise Awful was still making.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No, you won't. You'll put her down," said Quentin. Long practice had given him a way of enlarging his voice so that it came through Awful's. "Or you will if you want to hear yourself speak."</p>
<p class="bodytext">This seemed to strike the Goon as a good idea. He lowered Awful to the floor, where she stood putting her tongue in and out and making disgusted faces. "He tastes horrible," she said. "Can I go on yelling?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No," said Quentin, and he said to the Goon, "I don't know what you're talking about. I've never heard of this Archer. The man I deal with is Mountjoy."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Don't know Mountjoy," said the Goon. "Must go to Archer in the end. Archer didn't get it."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"But I tell you I sent it," Quentin insisted. "I sent it last week. I know it was late, but Mountjoy never bothers, as long as it's the full two thousand words." He turned to Fifi. "<i>You</i> know I sent it, don't you? It was that long envelope I gave you last week to drop in at the Town Hall."</p>
<p class="bodytext">It seemed to Howard that Fifi gave the faintest gasp at this, but she said promptly, "Oh, was that what it was? Yes, you did."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Well then?" Quentin said to the Goon.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon folded his long arms and loomed a little. "Archer didn't get it," he repeated.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Then go ask Mountjoy about it," said Quentin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"You ask him," said the Goon. His round eyes slid sideways to the telephone on the desk.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"All right," said Quentin. "I will." He went to the telephone and dialed. Howard, watching and listening and by now quite mystified, knew that his father really did dial the Town Hall. He heard the switchboard girl answer, "City Council. Which office, please?" And Quentin said, "Mr. Mountjoy. Extension sixohnine." After a pause he could hear a man's voice, a rich, rumbling voice, answering. Quentin, looking unlovingly at the Goon, said, "Quentin Sykes here, Mountjoy. It's about my two thousand words. Someone seems to have sent me a hired assassin&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Not killed anyone yet!" the Goon protested.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"You shut up," said Quentin. "He says the words are overdue. Now I know I sent them to you, just as usual, nearly a week ago&mdash;"</p>
<p class="bodytext">The rich voice rumbled on the telephone. And rumbled more. Quentin's face clouded and then began to look exasperated. He cut through the rumbling to say, "And who is Archer?" The voice rumbled some more. "Thank you," said Quentin. He put the phone down and turned to the Goon, sighing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon's grin grew wide again. "Didn't get them, did he?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No," Quentin admitted. "They do seem to have gone astray. But he'll give me another week to&mdash;" He stopped because the Goon's little head was shaking slowly from side to side. "Now look here!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Archer won't wait," said the Goon. "Want to go without electricity? Or gas? Archer farms power."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I know," Quentin said angrily. "Mountjoy just told me."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Do the words again," said the Goon.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Oh, all right," Quentin said. "Come on, all of you. Let's get back home and get it over with."</p>
<p class="bodytext">They marched silently back with the Goon looming over them. Howard was aching to ask his father what on earth was going on, but he did not get a chance. As soon as they reached the house, the Goon took up his former place, filling half the kitchen, and Quentin hurried to his study. The sound of typing came from there, in little rattling bursts, with long pauses in between. Awful went to the front room, where she turned on the television and sat brooding on bad things to do to the Goon. At least, Howard thought thankfully, Mum had not come in yet. He hoped very much that Dad could finish his typing and get rid of the Goon before she did.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the kitchen Fifi was climbing back and forth across the Goon's legs again. "Help me get supper started at least, Howard, there's a love," she said. "Your mum's going to be so <i>depressed</i> when she comes in and finds all this going on!"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Catriona Sykes came in five minutes after that. She came in with her eyes shut, tottering, meaning it had been a bad day. Her job was organizing music in schools, and she got headaches from it. She put a stack of music, the evening paper, a tape deck, a bundle of recorders, and a set of cymbals down on the table and fell into a chair by feel, with her hands to her head. Howard watched the relief fading off her face as she listened to the sounds in the house and began to realize something was wrong. He saw her locate Awful by the sound of the television, and Quentin by the clattering of the typewriter, then Fifi by the hurried pouring of hot water into the coffee mug Fifi had ready. Howard saw Catriona follow the haste with which Fifi handed the mug to him and locate Howard by his footsteps hurriedly stepping over the Goon's legs to give her the coffee. A frown grew on her face. As she took the mug, her head tilted to catch the scraping from the Goon's knife as he sat cleaning his nails. She took a deep drink of the coffee, pushed her hair back, and opened her eyes to look at the Goon.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Who are you?" she said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He grinned his daft grin at her. "Goon," he said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I mean," said Catriona, "what is your name?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard's mother had a very strong personality. But so had the Goon in his way. The room seemed thick with them. Howard and Fifi both held their breaths. "Goon will do," said the Goon, and went on grinning.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Catriona gave him a long, level look. Then, to Howard's surprise, she smiled quite pleasantly. "You look strong," she said. "There's a set of drums in my car. Help Howard get them in before they get damp or stolen."</p>
<p class="bodytext">And to Howard's further surprise, the Goon got to his feet and loomed through the room. "Where to?" he asked Howard.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon was so strong that all Howard needed to do was show him the car and unlock the back. The Goon carried the drum set, bumping and booming, and set it down with a further boom in the hall. Then he went back to his chair in the kitchen. There Howard could see his mother had been asking Fifi what was going on. Fifi was looking upset. Catriona was taking it all much more calmly than Howard would have expected. She was just looking gloomily mystified.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"I don't mind as long as he's quiet," she said to Howard. "I've been listening to school orchestras all day&mdash;have you done your violin practice?&mdash;and my head's splitting." And before Howard needed to lie about the violin, she looked at the Goon and said, "Who is Archer?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon looked back. He had a short think. "Farms power," he said. "Gas and electricity. Money, too. Won't worry you. You come under Torquil."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"You mean he's a town councillor?" Catriona asked.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That amused the Goon highly. He threw back his little head and laughed and clapped his long thigh with his vast hand. "That's good!" he said. "Look like the Council, do I?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">"No, I can't say that you do," said Catriona. She seemed utterly unable to find the Goon alarming. "He seems harmless enough," she said to Howard as she got up to help Fifi cook. "Move your feet," she said to the Goon. And the Goon did. He bent his legs up until his knees were near his ears and sat looking like a huge, ungainly grasshopper while Catriona got supper ready. Howard began to see that his mother had found the right way to manage the Goon. He tried it himself when he was setting the table. He told the Goon to get out of the way of the spoon drawer, and the Goon did and grinned at him. "Set for six, Howard," Catriona said. "I expect the Goon would like some liver and bacon, too."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Would!" the Goon said. He inhaled fried onions and grinned deeply.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard began to feel that Mum was not taking a serious enough view of the Goon. When supper was ready, and Quentin's typewriter was still doing bursts of clattering, Catriona said, "Howard, call your father and Awful."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Not Sykes. Let him keep at it," the Goon said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Catriona accepted this without even asking why and sent Howard into the study with a tray. Quentin looked up absently from his typewriter and said, "Put it down on those papers." He did not seem alarmed or anxious either.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Dad," said Howard, "I think Mum's got the wrong idea. She's giving the Goon supper. You don't give hired assassins supper, do you?"</p>
<p class="bodytext">Quentin smiled. "No, but when a wolf follows your sleigh, you give it meat," he said. Howard could tell he was only halfserious. "Leave me in peace, or we'll never get rid of him."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard went back to the kitchen, rather exasperated. He found the Goon sheepishly trying to wedge his knees under the table and Awful protesting. "I'm not going to have supper with him!" she was saying. "He threw his knife at me."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Shouldn't have screamed," said the Goon. The table lifted on top of his knees, and things began to slide off one end. Fifi caught them. She looked as exasperated as Howard felt. The Goon slid Catriona an embarrassed look and doubled his legs around the back of his chair. He was really almost kneeling like that, and he looked very uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"He did, Mum!" Awful shrilled. "And he smells." When Catriona took no notice, Awful announced, "I hate everyone except Fifi."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"What have I done to get hated?" Howard demanded. "You were scared of the Goon," Awful said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Howard found himself exchanging a shamed look with the Goon. "Scare myself sometimes," the Goon remarked, cautiously picking up a knife and fork. He was trying to behave properly. He kept glancing nervously at Catriona and Fifi to see how he was doing, and he made strong efforts to keep his mouth shut while he chewed. Howard thought he nearly choked once or twice. Even so, the Goon managed to eat huge amounts. Howard had never seen such a stack of potatoes on anyone's plate before. When he had finished, the Goon retreated quickly to the chair he had sat in before and sat in everyone's way again, picking his teeth with his knife and looking relieved.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Wouldn't you like to go watch the telly in the other room?" Fifi asked him after she had fallen over his legs six times.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But the Goon shook his little head and sat on. He sat while Fifi cleared away and then went up to her room in the attic. He sat while Catriona washed up. When Catriona went away, too, and the Goon was still sitting, Howard thought he had better stay in the kitchen as well. He felt someone ought to watch him. So Howard fetched out his bag of books, with the rip in it that the Goon had made, and tried to do homework on the kitchen table. He found it hard to concentrate. With the Goon sitting there, he did not feel he could spend half the time designing spaceships, as he usually did. He could feel the Goon's round eyes staring at him and see the knife that had ripped his bag flashing at the corner of his eye. When, at last, Quentin came into the kitchen carrying four typewritten pages, Howard was heartily relieved.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon sprang up, looking as relieved as Howard. He took the pages and examined them. Howard was quite surprised that the Goon seemed able to read.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"That will have to do," Quentin said as the Goon looked questioningly at him. "It's not quite the same as I sent Mountjoy, but it's as near as I could manage from memory."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Not a copy?" asked the Goon.</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Definitely no copy," Quentin assured him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Goon nodded, folded the papers, and stuffed them into the front of his leather jacket. "Get along to Archer then," he said. "See you." And he loomed his way to the back door, tore it open, ducked his little head under the lintel, and went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As soon as the door slammed, Catriona and Awful shot into the kitchen. "Has he gone?" said Awful, and Catriona said, "Now tell us what all that was about."</p>
<p class="bodytext">"Nothing&mdash;nothing at all really," Quentin said, in a way which everyone knew was much too airy. "Mountjoy's idea of a joke, that's all."</p>
<p class="bodytext">Catriona fixed him with her most powerful look. "Quentin," she said, "that won't do. He talked about Archer, not Mountjoy. Explain."</p>
