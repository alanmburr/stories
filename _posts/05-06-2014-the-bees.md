title: The Bees
description: |
  Flora 717 is a sanitation worker, a member of the lowest caste in her orchard 
  hive where work and sacrifice are the highest virtues and worship of the beloved 
  Queen the only religion. But Flora is not like other bees. With circumstances 
  threatening the hive’s survival, her curiosity is regarded as a dangerous flaw 
  but her courage and strength are an asset. She is allowed to feed the newborns in 
  the royal nursery and then to become a forager, flying alone and free to collect 
  pollen. She also finds her way into the Queen’s inner sanctum, where she discovers 
  mysteries about the hive that are both profound and ominous. Excerpt from amazon.com
